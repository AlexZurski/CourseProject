  some ontological analysis some ontological analysis we now embark on building conceptual model for data concepts rbr seems relevant here so we will try to generalize rbr to representation in general after all data seems to be in part representation of how things are we develop fragment of afr br like conceptual model for representation two problems appear when we try to apply this model to data the two middle entity types appear to simultaneously collapse into single entity type explode into an indefinite number of entity types generalizing rbr the cascade of representations we saw in the last video data rdf triples serialization ascii encoding work expression manifestation item the same data can be realized in triples relations or tree just as the same work can be realized in english or french expressions text the same triples can be encoded in rdf xml or turtle just as the same expression can encoded in helvetica or times manifestation and soon and work and we need languages to express both works and data right and those languages are realized in different ways and eventually instantiated in the physical world model for representation in general in order to cover data concepts we need something more general than rbr we need conceptual model for representation and for concrete ness west art with linguistic representation in the conceptual model of linguistic representation that follows there will be four key entity types proposition meaning sentence linguistic expression of proposition encoding representation of sentence inscription physical instantiation of an encoding the plan is to identify the ontological kind for each and then replace the linguistic model with more general one propositions representation typically involves the presentation of propositional content propositions maybe defined variously as the content of assertions the objects of belief doubt etc the proper bearers of truth and falsity the meanings of declarative sentences for our purposes today these are all the same things propositions vs sentences sue astrid sch nee is sue and astrid are using different sentences to say the same thing so same proposition different sentences sentences vs encodings snow is white listen while say it out loud one is in particular writing system consisting of grapheme punctuation etc another in particular speech system consisting of phonemes stress pitch etc they are using different symbols to encode the same sentence so same sentence different encodings encodings vs inscriptions snow is white snow is white snow is white same encoding different inscriptions 10 comparison with rbr so maybe work proposition expression sentence manifestation encoding item inscription looks about right no 11 ok where have we got to how about rbr linguistic representation entity type work proposition proposition expression sentence manifestation encoding item inscription patterned matter energy 12 hmm rbr linguistic representation entity type work proposition proposition expression sentence manifestation encoding item inscription patterned matter energy 13 propositions symbol structure symbol structure matter energy oh oh 14 propositions symbol structure symbol structure matter energy re near dub in 2007 encodings everywhere snow is white proposition can be expressed by sentence can be encoded by snow is white characters which can be encoded by snow is white glyphs which can be encoded by 83110111 integers which can be encoded by numerals which can be encoded by 010100110110111001101111 binary octets but how many levels are there here really there can be any number the situation we have an indefinite number of symbolic encodings not just one or two the first level seems to be similar to afr br expression the rest seem to be either encoding an expression or encoding an encoding taking liberties here to make point 15 where are we now we have two problems paradoxically inconsistent we need to replace the middle two entity types with one entity type as both appear to be the same sort of thing symbol structures we need to replace the middle two entity types with many entity types to accommodate the many levels of encoding the solution to these problems which emerges in the next two videos provides powerful conceptual insights into the nature of digital representation 16
