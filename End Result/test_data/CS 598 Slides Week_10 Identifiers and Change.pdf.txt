identifiers and change acknowledgements this unit draws on work carried out collaborative ly at the school of information sciences university of illinois at urbana champaign the principal researchers allen re near and karen wicket are grateful for conversations with many people but are particularly indebted to dank orman and dave dub in thanks also to simone sacchi and richard urban and the other members of the school seminar identity and change in information systems and the research group conceptual foundations of information science the image part with relationship id rid was not found in the file the image part with relationship id rid was not found in the file change managing data means managing change trans coding format conversion reduction extraction correction addition generalization specialization and soon and on and on and on we manage change with fine grained machine readable workflow documentation and identifiers are at the heart of this but which of the things in the workflow actually change or more generally what do we mean by change change in the digital world the digital world appears to be place of constant change digital documents are modified as sentences are revised datasets undergo corrections database tables are updated are records are inserted and deleted files get larger as more data is included and soon and yet all this is an illusion most things in the digital world are absolutely immutable understanding immutability the demonstration is simple and not restricted to digital objects consider the sentence remember verona let it be the first sentence of the first chapter of draft of novel suppose the authored its this sentence to read remember but dimly verona the first sentence of the draft has been modified it is now longer it was three words long and it is now five words long but exactly what got longer what is it that was three words and is five words remember verona no it was three words but it still is three words remember but dimly verona no it is five words but has always been the paragraph chapter the entire draft no those are just longer character strings in search of before going further what is change losing or gaining property right so something is modified change diff there is sometime when it has property and some later time when it does not have that property and we dont count merely relational changes you dont change really intrinsically when someone in iceland stops talking about you eventhough you had the property of being talked about by someone in iceland and then you lost that property when they stopped talking about you but in the case of the verona sentence there is no plausible candidate entity for the thing that is modified that is nothing seems to fit in the logical expression had length had length something was words long at one time and words long at another time from aristotle there must be substrate underlying all processes of becoming and changing what can this be in the present case physics kii 226 but what is the the subject substratum the of change in the case of the verona sentence the part where we take some of it back we are not totally insane really we arent we dont deny that the first sentence was words and is now can express true proposition what we deny is that it expresses the proposition it appears to express had length xt 13 had length xt 25 we are denying that the first sentence was words and is now words is literally true idiom metaphor and other logical disasters compare the average plumber has 32 children is average plumber num children 32 or there is scarcity of commonsense in this room is scarcity of commonsense is in this room similarly in our case jane lengthened the first sentence does not mean xyz had length xt had length xt zz or more generally lumber gh revised the tps memo can express true assertion but that assertion is not there is something atp memo that was revised by lumber gh is atp me mox revised by lumber gh is this just trick are we exploiting scope ambiguity in the first sentence in the novel for comparison the first person in the coffee queue has changed at 100 pm the first person in the queue was an oldman bat 101 pm the first person in the queue was young woman but noone thinks that this means there exists an such that was an oldman at one time and then at slightly later timex was young woman and that is exactly the point digital object modification is just like coffee queue processing the queue changes the people dont despite sentences and above note that you cant replace the phrases the first person in the queue with uniquely referring co referential proper name and get the same result why worry the price of metaphor the price of metaphor is eternal vigil an cercle wont in models mathematics and metaphor syn these 1963 attributed to rosen blue th and wiener the unforgiving nature of logic based languages in ferenc ing over formal on to logie is increasingly important but it is based assertions in logic based data representation language and such assertions allow only literal interpretation humans on the other hand communicate with natural language sentences the deploy idiom metaphor and other rhetorical features than conceal logical form for instance the sun rose in the east fog of anxiety descended upon the congregation the average plumber has 32 children edited the draft the tps memo was revised but computational in ferenc ing requires literal interpretation including compositional semantics existential instantiation valid deductive inference naive formalization of our familiar discourse about documents fails this requirement the underlying ontology need not reflect the latest theories of modern physics but it should nevertheless atleast be consistent 10 stitching this together now lets connect this with earlier discussions of identity and change usually when we are documenting change with respect to digital object the digital object itself is not changing eventhough we say it is however its relationships are changing and new things are appearing and playing new roles for instance we identify data set as temperature observations at place and time we convert that data set from json representation to xml representation now what precisely and literally has changed intrinsically the observations have nt they are the same and the representations have nt changed either yes we have new and different representations but each is exactly what it is has been will be and nothing was once the old representation but is now the new 11 some practical conclusions in slogan use identifiers to identify not to describe use non descriptive opaque identifiers to identify digital objects eg ds 0021 for data set do not use descriptive expressions as identifiers eg temperature area 32 not validated csv such descriptive identifier maybe factually incorrect or need to be revised as things change and it makes lousy data storage system in any case recognize that digital objects do not undergo intrinsic non relational change but that they do undergo relational change eg ds 0021 can change from being un reviewed to being reviewed but such changes do not affect original object identity obviously there are some challenges to this assertion that are best handled by compromise sometimes we need system model than allows files for instance to undergo byte based changes but when we do this we court trouble if we also in the same model define file as sequence of bytes as we now have an inconsistent model 12 if you are interested in more of this sort of thing when digital objects change exactly what changes in proceedings 71 st annual meeting of the american society for information science and technology allen re near david dub in and karen wicket 2008 documents cannot be edited in proceedings of bali sage the markup conference allen re near and karen wicket 2009 there are no documents in proceedings of bali sage the markup conference 2010 allen re near and karen wicket 201013 the argument from extensional it of sets digital objects are defined as kinds of strings tuples relations graphs etc all of these are in turn are defined mathematically as kinds of sets sets are extensional entities they cannot lose or gain members this is formal consequence of all standard set theories two sets are the same if and only if they have the same members many digital objects like documents can be defined as string string is function fna from the natural numbers into some codomain of elements so string is subset of nx east ring is set and therefore strings cannot lose or gain elements editing strings is really just mapping from string to string not modifying persistent underlying entity although not immediately or without additional axioms it is widely believed that that claim that sets have their members essentially follows immediately from the fc axiom of extensional it it doesnt but it does eventually follow given few other plausible assumptions james van cl eve why do sets have their members essentially 198514
