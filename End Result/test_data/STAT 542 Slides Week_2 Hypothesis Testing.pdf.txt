hypothesis testing in linear regression models the key testis the test compare two nested models ih reduced model with co iha full model with paco nested if the reduced model is special case of the full model eg hay note that rss rss and pap test test statistic frs rss pap rss an pa which pap npa under then ulli numerator variation per dim in the data not explained by the reduced model but explained by the full model ie evidence supporting hai denominator variation per dim in the data not explained by either model which is used to estimate the error variance reject iff stat is large ie the variation missed by the reduced model when being compared with the error variance is large special cases of the test the so called test for each regression parameter seether output is special case off test for example the test for the th coe fj compares ih xj xj xp hay xj xj xj xp the overall test at the bottom of the output compares ih hay xj xj xj xp
