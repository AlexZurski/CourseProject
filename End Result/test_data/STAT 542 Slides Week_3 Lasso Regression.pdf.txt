lasso start with the simple case in which is orthogonal how to derive the solution lasso understand the selection shrinkage of lasso what the between lasso and ridge coordinate decent for general leave the computation tor what if pn how to select the tuning parameter seer page 28 the lasso solution is to be lasso arg min rp ky jj suppose np is orthogonal ext ip the nky ky xls xlsx ky xls xlsx 22 where the cross product term xl st xlsx rt xlsx since then dim vector in red which is linear combination of columns of no matter what value takes is in cx therefore orthogonal to the residual vector also note that the st term in is not function of therefore 29 lasso arg min rp ky jar gm in rp xlsx jar gm in rp hls txt xls jji arg min rp hls tls jji arg min pp xj hj ls jji so we can solve the optimal for each of separately by solving the following generic problem arg min xx xj 030
