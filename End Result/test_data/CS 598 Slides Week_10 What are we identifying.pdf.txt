identity and identifiers content sv why is identification important what are we identifying how do we identify practical example xml canonical iz ation what are we identifying what exactly needs to be identified lots of things to be identified we need identifiers for lots of things because without shared identifiers we cannot reliably communicate what we are taking about so persons properties values counties automobiles nations proteins events etc everything there are some shared standards in specialized domains and some good systems for developing identifiers but much remains to done identifiers are at the heart of the semantic web identifiers in rd fowl are uris http example org spiderman http www perceive net schemas relationship enemy of http example org green goblin or literals http example org spiderman http xmlns com oaf 01 name all these are important in data cu ration but in this video we will focus on identifiers for datasets identity and representation levels again consider two files with the same data but relational tables in one case and rdf triples in another same data different representations identity and representation levels consider two files with same data and the same rdf triples but an xml serialization in one case and ann serialization in the other identity and representation levels consider two files with the same data same rdf triples same serialization but an ascii character encoding in one case vs an ebc dic encoding in another identity and representation level show many of these levels are there how do we name define and manage them how can they be identified andre identified the basic representation model orf rbr refactored instantiation level semantic level syntax level encoding levels based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al for example propositions expressed by rdf triples encoded by rdf xml encoded by unicode characters encoded by utf bitstream inscribed in actual raid array state all mm propositional so what are we identifying instantiation level semantic level syntax level encoding levels based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al for example propositions expressed by rdf triples encoded by rdf xml encoded by unicode characters encoded by utf bitstream inscribed in actual raid array state all mm propositional
