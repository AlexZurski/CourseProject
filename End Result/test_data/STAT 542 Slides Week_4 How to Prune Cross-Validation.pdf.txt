the steps above generate solution path max froot no deg 0012 all possible values of are grouped in tom intervals 001 112 mm where all ii share the same optimal subtree ti 19 cross validation how to choose fold cross validation part fit big tree max and compute im set 001 12 pm mm where each is atypical value for its interval ij 20 divided at into groups and repeat kf it full model on the data set except the th group and determine the optimal subtree st tmf root no deg compute the prediction error on the th group for each tree models produce the cvp lot over values and pick the optimal minor se 21
