  what is data what is data now we can finally answer this question we give an answer based on our ontology and we note that data is role and so it is relative in two senses nothing is data intrinsically only with respect to use the same propositions can be data in one circumstance and claim supported by data in another and it is routinely the case in science that recall our final slide from before cf john searle instantiation level semantic level syntax level encoding levels based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al propositional interpretative frames data our definition data are propositions systematically asserted ii as evidence du binet al 200920146 propositions by illustration and very roughly two declarative sentences that say the same thing express the same proposition asserted in order to be asserted propositions must be expressed in language encoded in symbols inscribed in material forms owe see that human intentional it is fundamental to the idea of data why because expressing encoding and inscribing are not things that just happen naturally they require conventions created and maintained by communities of persons as well as particular beliefs intentions and practices based on those conventions evidence what is it for propositions to be evidence for something we dodge this epistemological question but we know it when we see it right is being data type or role all data consists of propositions but not all propositions are data only propositions that are asserted are data and not asserted propositions are data either only those intended to serve as evidence data is not type of thing it is role just as persons are students when enrolled in school propositions are data when asserted as evidence being asserted as evidence is contingent and social circumstance and so data is role that propositions have in certain contingent social circumstances what kind of thing is data evidence for we think of data as being evidence for things such as theories hypotheses conjectures claims assertions claims but what kind of thing is claim both data and claims appear to be ontologically the same kind of thing propositions in role data are propositions in the role of being asserted as evidence claims are propositions in the role of being asserted as supported by evidence in order to be considered data data need not be believed sufficient to confirm or justify the claim it is offered as evidence for and atleast arguably it need not even be believed to increase likelihood of those claims being asserted as evidence could betaken as meaning being considered as potentially evidence this would allow the assertion to be agnostic with respect to normative evidentiary weight data and claims both are roles so what makes in some scenario some propositions data evidence and other propositions claims only the actions and intentions of particular person or persons there is nothing intrinsic to data that makes data data and nothing intrinsic to claims that makes claims claims being data is role that some propositions have in certain contingent social circumstances and the same for claims data is relative so whether propositions are data or claims depends upon what is intended and propositions can be data in one circumstance claims in another in fact science as whole depends on this for instance for climate scientist growth rings on tree rounds maybe evidence for theories about temperature changes but for an evolutionary ecologist those theories about temperature changes may in turn be evidence for theories about competitive advantages in slogan some relevant publications the sam model for datasets proceedings of the 73 rd annual meeting of the american society for information in science and scholarship re near allen simone sacchi karen wicket 2010 proceedings of the 74 th annual meeting of the american society for information in science and scholarship sacchi simone karen wicket david dub in allen re near 2011 content format and interpretation proceedings of bali sage the markup conference dub in david wicket karen sacchi simone 2011 proceedings of the 75 th annual meeting of the american society for information in science and scholarship wicket karen simone sacchi david dub in allen re near 2012
