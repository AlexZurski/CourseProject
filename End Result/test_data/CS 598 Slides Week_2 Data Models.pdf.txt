   data models what is data model some examples of data models why data models are important to data curation towards an integrated picture of data model relationships some data models you know and

that conceptualized as attribute value pairs this particular relational model includes the attributes title and date it is modeling state of affairs where novel moby dick was published in 1851 work

worm line that flies in the nightline in the howling storm stanza line has found out thy bed line of crimson joy line and his dark secret love line does thy life destroy here tree model is being used this particular tree is serialized in xml tree models are well suited for data that has tree like or hierarchical structure such as documents but they can also be used to serialize relations and other model instances in this tree the nodes have labels such as stanza and line it is modeling poem that has two stanzas each with four metrical lines the entity relationship model here is ner schema er models operate at high of abstraction representing the things and relationships of domain in this er schema there are two entity classes person and work each entity class has several attributes and there is relationship authored that obtains between entities in those classes both relation and tree data models and be used to implementer models for our purposes er diagrams uml class diagrams other conceptual modeling approaches rdf sandow land other ontology languages are all fundamentally similar and maybe all be considered ways of specifying an ontology namebirth first published title death person work author id work id mm full authored what exactly is data model the phrase data model has three commonsense type of framework for representing information particular framework for representing information typically specified by schema the application of particular framework to represent information sense type of framework the relational model with attributes tuples and values is good one for organizing course registration information the tree model with nodes labels and edges excels at organizing natural language text the entity relationship model with entities and relationships identifies the things and relationships in domain of interest 10 sense particular framework schema the registrars relational model includes these attributes course prerequisites credits department and assigns credits the data type integer the journal uses an xml tree model it includes the nodes article title author affiliation it requires that title node must and may only appear as the first child of an article node the er model for registration includes the entities person course and department and the relationships enrolled in sponsored by and teaches it allows persons to teach multiple courses but requires that course be sponsored by just one department 11 sense the application of particular framework the registrars relational model has the value is 501 for course in the only tuple that has smith for instructor in the xml tree model for this article the node labelled author has the content alonzo church and the following sibling node affiliation has the content princeton university the rdf instance of that ontology model shows that anton marty is enrolled in dr brentano course 12 what is data model elaborated data models typically have three sorts of components structure sets and tuples nodes and arcs things values labels entities relationships constraints data types grammars cardinality often the specification of operations is considered essential data model is mathematical formalism with two parts notation for describing data set of operations used to manipulate that data ullman 198813 why are we talking about data models because critical activities in data curation include select data model types select data model schemas develop data model schemas revised at model schemas document data model schemas validate data set instances with schemas transform data in one model type to another data model type transform data in one model schema to another data model schema transform data from one representation eg serialization to another with same schema integrating data from two different data models schema or type and more 14 looking ahead data model relationships critical issue in data curation has to do with how different types of data models and different data models of the same type are related to one another this is question we will take up in detail later in the course but here partial diagram of the territory ahead 15 data model relationships 16 relations eg relational databases schemas column and key descriptions trees eg xml documents schemas grammar seg dtd entities relationships conceptual models uml or er models on to logie triple seg rdf triple stores schemas serialization descriptions conceptual level physical level or storage logical level files records delimiters data structures indexes etc schema serum schemas rdf owl
