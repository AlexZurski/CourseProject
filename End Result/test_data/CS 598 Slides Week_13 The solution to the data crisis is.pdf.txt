communication and data curation the solution to the data crisis is more data recall the problem more relevant articles than any specialist could possibly read background how do scientists and other professionals read these day show could we help them read betterexamples obstacles the future are you kidding me adapted from jensen ric bork nature 2006 axis is 102 for total med line abstracts some big numbers 25000 publishers 15 million scholarly articles year 600000 abstracts added to med line each year so how do scientists and other professionals engage the literature user behavior during scientific search in eg pubmed sc opus google scholar web of science ads etc the search trance researchers engage with the literature as if playing videogame they rapidly almost subconsciously develop queries likely to find known items or retrieve subject or topic results track references backward and citations forward make rapid relevance judgments assessments of impact and quality locate and compare key terms equations definitions protocols findings this is almost sub cognitive kin aesthetic even trance like sessions are often considered successful eventhough no article to read was found and read their goal appears to be not finding an article to read but avoiding reading now this is nothing new indexing and citation analysis help decide whether articles are relevant without reading them abstracts and literature reviews help us take advantage of articles without reading them the articles we do read in their analyses and summaries help us take advantage of other articles without reading them friends colleagues and best of all graduate students help us take advantage of articles without reading them paper based strategic reading engineers describe common pattern for utilizing document components by zooming and filtering information they first read the abstract then skim section headings next lists summary statements definitions and illustrations they is aggregate andre aggregate article components for use in their own work perhaps by using marker to highlight perhaps by creating mental register bruce schatz et al federated search of scientific literature ieee computer 1999 online strategic reading informant used the sections of the papers for the equations even wouldnt read all the other parts of the article look for specific surface tensions experimental measurements sometimes need to look specifically at other methods and theories ann bishop document structure and digital libraries how researchers mobilize information in journal articles information processing and management 1999 10 longstanding behaviors sure but newly urgent key studies from cte no pir and king 20002007 showtime searching and browsing has been rising rapidly from 1984 to 2000 until the mid 1990 the numberofarticles read was more or less steady but since then the number read not browsed has been climbing and so reading time per article is dropping in some fields fairly fast 24 minutes in addition studies from cp almere tal 20002007 show researchers use sophisticated techniques to mobilize information according to varied research needs these information needs vary with discipline research lifecycle local and global and research strategies as well as with varying afford ances of current technology the pace of evolution and innovation in these techniques is increasing and increasingly driven by researchers themselves and not information specialists or publishers faster faster faster more more more 11 te no piret al 19772005 12 so what to do human reading of natural language prose is uniquely valuable providing nuance clarity and insight so reading cannot be totally replaced by text mining so lets provide tools that support strategic reading for example computationally available data items accessible with discipline specific tools chemical formulae proteins equations etc advanced navigation and viewing optimized for domain specific and objective specific browsing and analysis typed hypertext linking with links as first class objects data driven interactive diagrams and graphics computable equations supportive ontological in ferenc ing thoroughgoing interoperability with other tools and soon and on and on the grand old dream of radical new functionality as envisioned by paulo tle tv anne var bush douglas engelbart ted nelson et al
