  why the solution works university of illinois at urbana champaign clarification these models have two parts the heart of the relational model can be understood as the combination of the relational data structure with attributes for data values similarly the tree model as it is typically implemented combines the tree data structure with descriptive markup node labels or in xml terminology generic identifiers such as stanza we will now refer to the tree model as the tree dm model the phrase relational model does not need the clarification as the role of attributes is commonly understood drum roll can we say in general terms why the tree dm model works so well why it succeeds so well in meeting data management challenges we can it works the same way the relational model works abstraction and in direction abstraction both models focus on the data itself separate from storage and processing this explicit identification of data attributes in one case and logical text objects in the other brings enormous new functionality and efficiency once again in direction both models support an indirect relationship to storage and processing but in practice the emphasis is often different for the relational model abstracting away from storage is dominant for the tree dm model abstracting away from processing is dominant in both case the separation is mediated by mapping logical schema to physical schema in the case of the relational model text component type to processing instructions in the case of trees dm formal vs colloquial understanding of these data models although in the relational model we commonly think of attributes as representing dyadic properties or relationships in the world technically they are names for domains of values similarly in the tree dm model we think of these node labels as indicating the kind of enclosed text object stanza formula etc but in the model they are really simply names it is our colloquial understanding of these models that enables us to actually use them to secure useful abstraction and data management this may seem small point now but it motivates further advance in abstraction as we well see when we discuss on to logie
