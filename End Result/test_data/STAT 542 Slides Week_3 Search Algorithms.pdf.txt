search algorithms level wise search algorithm which returns the global optimal solution but only feasible for less than 40 variables note that the penalty is the same for models with the same size so the model with the smallest rss among all models of size where 12 then evaluate the score on the candidate models and report the optimal one greedy algorithms fast but only return local optimal solution which might be good enough in practice backward start with the full model and sequentially delete predictors until the score does not improve forward start with the null model and sequentially add predictors until the score does not improve stepwise consider both deleting and adding one predictor at each stage what if pn 10
