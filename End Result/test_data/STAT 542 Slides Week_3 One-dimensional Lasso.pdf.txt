how to solve one dim lasso fxx xj where is number and how to that minimize sfx the solution should satisfy the following equation xx xj xj where is the sub gradient of the absolute value function evaluated atx which equals to sign xi fx 60 and any number in 11 if 031 so the minimize of fxx xj is given by xs sign aja 28 if 20 if if is often referred to as the soft threshold ing operator 32 when the design matrix is orthogonal the lasso solution is given by lasso sign ls jj ls jj if ls jj 20 if ls jj large will cause some of the co to be exactly zero so lasso does both variable subset selection and soft shrinkage 33
