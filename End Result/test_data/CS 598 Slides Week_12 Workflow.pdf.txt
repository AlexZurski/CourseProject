 workflow and provenance anything profound and the cool slides is from bertram lu dsc her everything else is from re near work flow and provenance work flow provenance work flow systems work flow what is data work flow why is work flow important kinds of transformations what is data workflow much of our work with data especially in scientific applications consists in transforming one data set into another in the abstract software process embodying one or more algorithms takes one data set as input and produces another as output this process is what we mean hereby workflow these transformation scenarios range widely in kind and nature and can be extremely complex they are fundamental to data science and core focus of data curation data curation and data workflow data curation is concerned with transformations in two ways managing and documenting transformations involved in data analytics performing transformation to realize data curation objectives preservation integration format conversion etc kinds of data transformations transformations where input and output datasets are identical in propositional content transformation to different data description language or new version of language transformation to different serialization or new version of serialization transformations where the input data set mathematically contains the output data set transformation to subset matching specific conditions eg simple queries transformation to logically or mathematically entailed data of the same kind eg summaries statistics visualization transformations where the input data set scientifically contains in the output data set transformation to scientifically entailed data of the same kind here the resulting data set typically contains information different in kind eg data set about air pressure is transformed to data set about altitudes work flow chaotic vs organized vs supported there is always work flow even if it is an impenetrable untrustworthy chaotic mess organized work flows maybe either homegrown systems of documented scripts for instance supported by specialized work flow management systems kepler tavern ayes work flow etc practical work flow support systems are usually more or less language independent allowing the use of python xslt mat lab etc find ot uso tu hunter assign taxonomy tap profile alignments tap or infernal build phylogenetic tree ra xml or quick tree view treed end ros cope un if rac tree environment file assembled conti gs chimera check mallard diversity statistics text out list chao shannon graphs rarefaction curves rank abundance curves visualization tools cyto scape networks heat map waters work flow for alignment taxonomy ecology of ribosomal sequences amber hartman eisen lab uc davis ci pre cluster cluster cluster example bioinformatics workflow motif catcher marc fac cio tt iet luc davis genome center multi scale synthesis and terrestrial model inter comparison project stm ip christopher schwalm axing wei gene expression micro array data analysis normalize normalization of data across micro array datasets select deg selection of differential ly expressed genes between conditions go analysis determination of gene ontology statistics for the resulting datasets make heat map creation of heat map of the differential ly expressed genes tyler kol is nik mark bie da why is workflow important thoughtfully designed organized work flows support efficiency reliability modi fi ability reuse reproducibility
