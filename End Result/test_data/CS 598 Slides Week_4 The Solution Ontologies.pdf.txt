  the solution on to logie university of illinois at urbana champaign the solution on to logie the new problem review the solution historically entity relationship modeling what it is why it works on to logie generally what they are how they look today rdf owl style on to logie provide away to abstract away from data structures such as tables and trees and focus on information facts about things and relationships in the domain of interest and many data curation advantages ensure the heart of the matter we lack shared framework that could explicitly and formally map the relevant features in the domain of interest to the relation or tree schemas holding data about those things such framework could be used to guide relation and tree schema development and revision and to identify the common domain features reflected in different relation and tree schemas the framework would also provide relation and tree schemas with semantics and as consequence their instances relations and trees would have meaning and assert propositions without that we really dont know formally what relation or an xml document is telling us yes its in our head but that not good enough we need yet another level of abstraction the solution the old problem solution there are many different ways to use storage methods to store data so we need single data abstraction that allows us to work with data regardless of what storage methods are used the solution the relational model or the tree model the new problem there are many different ways use data abstractions to record information so we need single information abstraction that allows us to work with information regardless of how the data expressing that information is stored the solution the solution in 1976 peter chen proposed simple solution here my interpretation peter pin sha nchen the entity relationship model toward unified view of data acm transactions on database systems 1970 also one of the most influential papers in computer science conceptualize your domain of interest in terms of its things relationships etc and the nmap that conceptualization to whatever logical model schemas are being used this also changed

cardinality and participation constraints why is that logical basis important we now have description of the structure of the domain specification of the real world things attributes and relationships in that domain such as description can been called conceptual schema conceptual schema really is about the world its predicates correspond to real world properties they are not simply names of domains its variables range over real world individual things explicitly not by informal interpretation connecting conceptual schema to logical level schema can give the instances of that logical schema meaning formalizing how they express proposition show they express information about the world conceptual schemas solve the problem described earlier they can be used to guide the development of logical schemas or characterize the common of two different schemas that partially or totally equivalent and finally perhaps most importantly conceptual schemas provide critical documentation of the data set where does the mapping occur the most common use of conceptual models is to support the creation of logical schemas this typically involves the step by step generation of relational schemas from ner schema most of you are familiar with the algorithm for this there are many examples available on the web data curation point if your relational schema was generated mechanically from ner schema then that er schema reliably documents atleast partially the relationship between your view of the domain and your relational schema this is obviously very valuable generic conceptual modeling

represented knowledge is based on conceptualization the objects concepts and other entities that are assumed to exist in some area of interest and the relationships that hold among them conceptualization is an abstract simplified view of the world that we wish to represent for some purpose every knowledge base knowledge based system or knowledge level agent is committed to some conceptualization explicitly or implicitly tom gruber stanford what is an ontology conceptual models vs on to logie sidon see any useful distinction between conceptual models and on to logie and so will be using on to logie to include models like er nevertheless there are slight differences of emphasis on to logie almost always have class relationships and perhaps an extensive class hierarchy on to logie will often include very abstract concepts at the levels of that hierarchy physical object set event time interval property etc on to logie are usually intended to be relatives table and multipurpose on to logie are sometimes accompanied by logical axioms that support in ferenc ing sometimes specific formal technique is used for developing on to logie often in ontology development minimizing the number of general kinds of entities is concern conceptual models for xml trees you will have noticed that most of this discussion is about conceptual models or on to logie that can be mapped to relational schemas but what about the tree model what about xml documents with descriptive markup turns out that the semi structured nature of xml documents makes it very challenging to develop conceptual model that will play the same semantic role as er diagrams do for the relational model for more on that see towards semantics for xml markup proceedings of the 2002 acm symposium on
