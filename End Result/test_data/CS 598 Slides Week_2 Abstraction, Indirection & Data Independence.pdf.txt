  abstraction in direction data independence subtitle goes here university of illinois at urbana champaign abstraction in direction and data independence it is worth saying these things one more time abstraction in direction data independence fundamental principle in the data curation creed abstraction and in direction the success of the relational model is based primarily on two related principles abstraction and in direction the relational representation abstracts away from the specific and transient details of storage presenting only the intrinsic features of the data itself subs quentin ter action with the stored data is then indirect via mapping from the relational schemas to the stored data  adjusting the mapping manages data independence physical data independence the physical schema storage method can change without affecting interactions with the data the problem with direct interactions if the storage method switches from fixed field approach to delimited field approach then the access programs and other tools will return the wrong results the solution the physical schema logical schema mapping is adjusted to accommodate the changes adjusting the mapping manages data independence logical data independence the logical schema can change without affecting interactions with the data for instance if new attribute is accommodated by adding delimited field to the right side of record then any program or other tool that has been identifying fields by counting delimiters right to left will probably return the wrong result the solution again the physical schema logical schema mapping is adjusted to accommodate the changes with feeling abstraction implemented within direction supports data independence among other things this is fundamental principle in the data curation creed we will see it again and again in this course
