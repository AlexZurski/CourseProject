  the way forward roles and types types and roles in the last video we saw how our rbr inspired model for representation encountered two problems first it appeared that the two middle entity types should be collapsed into single entity type second it appeared that the two middle entity types should be expanded into an indefinite number of entity types so apparently some considerable refactoring is required in this video we present the foundation for this refactoring describing distinction types vs roles that has become fundamental in ontological analysis the first problem the collapse again how about rbr linguistic representation entity type work proposition proposition expression sentence symbol structure manifestation encoding symbol structure item inscription patterned matter energy propositions symbol structure symbol structure matter energy the second problem the proliferation again snow is white proposition can be expressed by sentence can be encoded by snow is white characters which can be encoded by snow is white glyphs which can be encoded by 83110111 integers which can be encoded by numerals which can be encoded by 010100110110111001101111 binary octets but how many levels are there here really there can be any number the situation we have an indefinite number of symbolic encodings not just one or two the first level seems to be similar to afr br expression the rest seem to be either encoding an expression or encoding an encoding taking liberties here to make point role and types intuitively we can distinguish two sorts of properties those that are roles and those that are types very roughly the property being student is role because persons are students only in virtue of particular contingent circumstances namely being enrolled in school the property being person is type because persons are persons regardless of contingent circumstances other properties that are roles parent president planet nearest the sun etc other properties that are types number color physical object copper water etc guar in welty 2000 formal ontology of properties roles vs types rigidity can help distinguish roles and types because types are rigid and roles are not defining rigidity in natural language property is rigid if and only if nothing that has it could exist and fail to have it in the past present or the future or in any alternative circumstances examples person number color physical object copper property is role if and only if anything that has it could exist and fail to have it in the past present or future or in any alternative circumstances examples student president parent planet nearest the sun adapted from guar in welty 2000 formal ontology of properties little more elucidation the property of being person is rigid nothing that is person could exist and fail to be person so physical object could not have existed and not been physical object eg have been color or number instead the property of being student is not rigid things that are students could exist and not be student so student maybe student now but if their life had gone otherwise they might not have been student or once you were not student now you area student soon you will not be student but everything that is person has been person since it existed and will always be person as long as it exists same for numbers colors physical objects etc the distinction in modal logic in modal logic rigidity is defined property is rigid dfx xx or in the model theoretic semantics for modal logic property is rigid df if is had by some in some possible world the nx has in every possible world in which exists guar in welty 2000 formal ontology of properties 10 are the middle entity types roles or types rbr with respect to the two models are are trying to align we can aska expression is symbol structure that realizes work manifestation is symbol structure that embodies an expression but symbols have their meanings only as result of contingent social convention in different circumstances symbol structures mean different things so both expressions and manifestations would seem to be roles not types 11 are the middle entity types roles or types language now lets consider our simple model of linguistic representation sentence is symbol structure that expresses proposition an encoding is symbol structure that encodes sentence but again symbols have their meanings only as result of contingent social convention in different circumstances symbol structures mean different things so both sentences and encodings would seem to be roles not types 12 the middle entity types are roles not types our model of type role relationship student is person enrolled in school so being student is role that things of particular type persons have in particular contingent circumstances this is parallel to sentence is symbol structure that expresses proposition an encoding is symbol structure that encodes sentence red types green roles so we can collapse the two middle entity types both are symbol structures the difference is difference of role not type 13 but what about the proliferation problems now is white proposition can be expressed by sentence can be encoded by snow is white characters which can be encoded by snow is white glyphs which can be encoded by 83110111 integers which can be encoded by numerals which can be encoded by 010100110110111001101111 binary octets but how many levels are there here really there can be any number the situation we have an indefinite number of symbolic encodings not just one or two the first level seems to be similar to afr br expression the rest seem to be either encoding an expression or encoding an encoding taking liberties here to make point 14 now we have simple solution some new definitions sentence is symbol structure that expresses proposition an encoding is symbol structure that encodes sentence or encoding so single entity type can with recursive relationships represent an indefinite number of encoding level show cool is that 15
