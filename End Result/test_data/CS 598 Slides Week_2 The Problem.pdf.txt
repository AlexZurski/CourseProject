  the problem subtitle goes here university of illinois at urbana champaign what the problem the situation circa 1960 data is stored in radically different ways interaction with data is immediately and directly via storage methods explicit and formal conceptualization of data as data is rare and typically only in human memory why is this problem huge operational inefficiencies lack of functionality lack of data independence what the problem imagine large company with many divisions left to itself each division will probably conceptualize their domain in different ways ii develop different methods of representation and storage iii mix processing instructions with data when convenient there will typically be no clear separation between storage methods and the intrinsic structure of the information being represented no general abstract understanding of the nature of the information being represented other than what is in the memories of staff and programmers flickr arnold reinhold  storage representations fixed length fields counting from the left 0625 58425 moby dick 1851 85246 the scarlett letter 1860 55427 fanshawe 1828 or from the right 28223 variable length fields delimited 54825 moby dick 1851 85246 the scarlett letter 1860 55427 fanshawe 1828 indexed byte offsets 00000000 work id 00000010 title 00000020 year 54825 moby dick 1851 85246 the scarlett letter 1860 55427 fanshawe 1828 the problems this causes with no formally defined general approach application development is arduous many different unique access subroutines must be developed tested and maintained tools developed for different divisions are not interoperable there cannot be sustainable rd party industry of common applications and tools specialized applications searching analysis etc must be custom developed cannot reference high level constructs all tools must be be modified often as storage formats change the problems this causes there are more problems caused by lack of general conception of data work flow and transformation cannot be usefully tracked audited or logged documentation cannot exploit conceptual understanding of the data documentation must be updated frequently for changes in storage format or processing changes data validation and quality assurance is difficult as standard tools for syntax checking typing constraint management etc cannot be used schemas if they exist focus only on storage and do not help us with general data management as result this result is that systems and practices are inefficient error prone untrustworthy difficult to document difficult tore purpose and reuse difficult to preserve for future use dependent on memory and workplace practices dependent on custom tools and applications 10 data independence one significant consequence of this chaos is failure of data independence this failure comes in two varieties type if the storage method changes then the end user programs accessing the data will fail to perform as expected type if new kinds of data need to be represented then again end user programs may fail or give the wrong result 11 first keep these variations in mind fixed length fields counting from the left 0625 58425 moby dick 1851 85246 the scarlett letter 1860 55427 fanshawe 1828 or from the right 28223 variable length fields delimited 54825 moby dick 1851 85246 the scarlett letter 1860 55427 fanshawe 1828 indexed byte offsets 00000000 work id 00000010 title 00000020 year 54825 moby dick 1851 85246 the scarlett letter 1860 55427 fanshawe 1828 lack of data independence type if the physical storage method changes then the end user programs accessing the data will fail to perform as expected for instance if the storage method switches from fixed field approach to delimited field approach then the access programs and other tools will return the wrong results 13 lack of data independence type if new kinds of data need to be represented then again end user programs may fail or give the wrong result for instance if new attribute is accommodated by adding delimited field to the right side of record then any program or other tool that has been identifying fields by counting delimiters right to left will probably return the wrong result 14
