  metadata schemas metadata schemas metadata schemas vocabulary independence syntax serialization independence mixing and matching metadata schemas examples of schemas metadata schemas set of data elements with specified meanings for supporting metadata statements in particular contexts sometimes vocabulary independent often syntax serialization independent pure metadata schemas are conceptual sometimes vocabulary independent metadata elements in metadata schema can be purely conceptual without controlled vocabulary by allowing different vocabulary terms for the same concept the schema can more gracefully support different languages as well as avoid or take advantage of common meanings for common words however advantages of having level of in direction between concept and term maybe outweighed by the advantages of providing controlled term vocabulary and so avoiding unnecessary variation so many metadata schemas specify controlled vocabulary as well as conceptual elements users who wish to use an alternative vocabulary for the same concepts can provide mapping pure metadata schemas are conceptual often syntax serialization independent similarly metadata schemas need not specify any particular syntax for applying specified concepts in this case most metadata schemas do strictly separate the conceptual schema from the variety of options for applying metadata to objects given the variety of contexts data models file formats etc in which metadata will be applied allowing metadata statements to implemented in different serialization syntax es is profoundly useful and essential for wide adoption recommended serialization syntax es can be developed and standardized independently eg dublin core http www dublin core org documents dc mi terms 15 elements for describing resources on the web with defined semantics and recommended vocabularies for elements contributor format rights coverage identifier source creator language subject date publisher title description relation type schemas vs their serialization creator william blake title sick rose date 1794 dublin core metadata element set select terms serialized as rdf xml xml namespace href http www org schemas rdf schema as rdf namespace href http www purl org rdf dc as dc rdf rdf rdf description rdf href http purl org metadata dublin core elements dc title the sick rose dc creator william blake dc date 1794 rdf rdf xml serialized with html meta elements meta named title content the sick rose meta named creator content william blake meta named date content 1794 combining specializing and extending metadata schemas metadata schemas can be combined specialized and extended in various ways for example defined application of dub in core may limit the values of the dublin core dc format element to the controlled vocabulary for iana media types mime types or specify the refinements spatial and temporal for dc coverage to ensure graceful processing of adaptations techniques for schema modification or other notifications may also be specified take look at these standard metadata schemas lists of metadata schemas biodiversity http www dc cac uk resources metadata standards list libraries and museums http jenn riley com metadata map seeing standards glossary pamphlet pdf other areas https enwikipedia org wiki metadata standard individual research groups businesses and other organizations may develop custom metadata schemas for private or limited use usually these are specializations of existing schemas
