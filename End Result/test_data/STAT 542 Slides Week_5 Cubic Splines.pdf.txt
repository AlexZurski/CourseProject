spline models introduction tocs and nc piecewise polynomials we divide the range of into several intervals and within each interval fx is low order polynomial eg cubic or quadratic but the polynomial co change from interval to interval in addition we require overall fx is continuous up to certain derivatives regression splines smoothing splines cubic splines knots 12 mba function gona is cubic spline rt knots fig mi if is cubic polynomial in each of them intervals gx dix cix bix aix ii where and is continuous up to the nd derivative since is continuous up to the nd derivative for any point inside an interval it to check 012 ig 012 ii 10 how many free parameters we need to represent gm we need parameters dic ibi for each of them intervals but we also have constraints at each of them knots so 13 mm 411 suppose the knots fig mi are given if and are two cubic splines so is where and are two constants that is for set of given knots the corresponding cubic splines form linear space of functions with dim 412 set of basis functions for cubic splines rt knots fig mi is given by xx xx xx hi xxi 12 that is any cubic spline fx can be uniquely expressed sfx xi hj of course there are many other choices of the basis functions for example ruses the splines basis functions 13 natural cubic splines ncsa cubic spline on ab is an csi fits second and third derivatives are zero at and that is an csis linear in the two extreme intervals and mb note that the linear function in two extreme intervals are totally determined by their neighboring intervals the degree of freedom of css with knots is for curve estimation problem with data xi yin if we put knots at then data points assumed to be unique then we obtain smooth curve using nc passing through ally 14
