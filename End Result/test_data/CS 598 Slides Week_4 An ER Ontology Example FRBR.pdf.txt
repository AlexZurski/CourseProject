  ner ontology example rbr university of illinois at urbana champaign ner ontology example rbr we will show how fragment of the rbr conceptual model was developed in order to support the complexities of library cataloguing although the example is from library cataloguing the solution is directly related to problems in data curation and digital asset management as we will see what is book did you read the same book did this can mean different things the same novel read yes but the french translation text the same text read yes but but the large type edition the same edition read yes but the copy in the summerhouse the same copy read the one with the mustard stain rbr functional requirements for bibliographic records the ordinary book can be simultaneously about manet in french typeset in neo bauhaus mustard stained which is strictly speaking impossibles of rbr replaces the book with four kinds of entities the work is about manet the expression is in french the manifestation is typeset in neo bauhaus the item is mustard stained the rbr group entity types there are four group entity types work distinct intellectual or artistic creation expression the intellectual or artistic realization of work in the form of alphanumeric musical or choreographic notation sound image etc manifestation the physical embodiment of an expression of work item single exemplar of manifestation or colloquially for book like objects work text edition copy illustrative attribute assignments each entity type is assigned distinctive set of attributes works have attributes such as subject and genre expressions have attributes such as language manifestations have attributes such as typeface items have attributes such as condition and location nb these attribute assignments are disjoint work may have subject it does not have language typeface or condition an expression may have language it does not have subject manifestation may have typeface it does not have subject or language an item may have condition it does not have subject language or typeface foundations rbr generalizes current best practice in cataloguing and bibliographic control reflects an emerging theoretical consensus

scientist asks what data do you have joe hour cle nasa sda cfr brin scientific context 2007 as we will see 10 the method simplified in two steps the first step in the entity analysis technique is to isolate the kinds types objects entities that are of interest dont focus on data but on the things the data describe each entity type becomes focal point for cluster of data once this high level structure for the model has been charted identify the important attributes of each entity identify relationships between entities identify attributes and values 11 relationships between the entities types the novel moby dick work is realized through many different expressions the particular texts of moby dick the text of the 1859 edition the corrected edition the murray french translation each of which maybe embodied in many various manifestations the 1859 edition microform of that edition an ebook with the 1859 text each of which may exemplified by many different items my copy the houghton
