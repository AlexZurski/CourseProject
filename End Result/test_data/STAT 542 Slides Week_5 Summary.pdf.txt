weighted spline models we can always assume all is are otherwise we just need to weighted regression model due to the following argument suppose the two ob have the same value ex where the ny gx 12 gx 122 xi yi 22 22 gx 12 222 2222 22 gx 12 so we can replace the two ob by one 22 and its weight is while the weights for other ob are 132 summary smoothing splines start with model with the maximum complexity nc with knots at unique points fit ridge regression model on the data if we parameter ize then cs function space by the dr basis then the design matrix is orthogonal and the corresponding coi ent is penalized no penalty for the two linear basis functions higher penalties for wigglier basis function show to do it in how to select the tuning parameter or equivalently the df what if we have collected two ob at the same location 36
