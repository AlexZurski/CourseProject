identity and identifiers content sv why is identification important what are we identifying how do we identify practical example xml canonical iz ation an example canonical iz ation here we give an example of canonical iz ation central strategy for determining identity of representation or propositional content canonicalization canonicalization is technique for determining representational identity and is reasonable proxy for propositional identity it is most directly applicable when the representation syntax of the two datasets is the same but there are variations in encoding alternative synonymous variation within single language xml as an example imagine two xml files assume they both define the same data structure the same labelled graph with attribute value pairs but they could have different pretty printing conventions end tags indented or not spaces stabs or different character encodings or different line end encodings or they may have multiple ways to define the same data structure eg global defaults for attribute values vs local specification random order for attribute value pairs on element vs some other random order and soon these quite different files can specify the exact some data structure but how can we tell this is the problem canonical iz ation goes after canonical iz ation recipe here is simple example of how xml canonical iz ation might work to determine whether or not two xml files determine the same data structure convert to single character encoding and normalize line ends remove all comments tabs non significant spaces etc propagate all attribute defaults indicated in the schema to the elements themselves put attribute value pairs on elements in alpha order expand all character references remove any internal schema or declarations now test to see if character sequences are identical canonical zed normal forms as proxies for propositional content oki see you have noticed we seem to have walked away from identifying propositional content are we giving up no but discretion is the better part of valor so we are compromising when single data description language is being used fixity checksum on files in canonical normal form is for all practical purposes our best shot at sameness of propositional content alternative approaches can be imagined but they are difficult to readings required persistent identifiers fixity and checksums in the digital preservation handbook digital preservation coalition 2017 on the utility of identification schemes for digital earth science data an assessment and recommendations due rr red owns rr til mes bark strom ble nhard tw glassy bermudez le slaughter 2011 earth science informatics clifford lib magazine 59 september 1999 canonical xml version 10 recommendation john boyer march 2001 latest version http www org tr xml 14
