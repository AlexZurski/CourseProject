 workflow and provenance anything profound and the cool slides is from bertram lu dsc her everything else is from re near work flow systems work flow systems requirements examples provenance in work flow provenance standards cool slides immediately or mediate ly from bertram lu dsc her essential functions of scientific work flow system automate programs and services scientists already use schedule invocations of programs and services correctly and efficiently in parallel where possible manage data flow to from and between programs and services enable scientists not just developers to author or modify work flows easily predict what work flow will do when executed prospective provenance record what happened during work flow execution retrospective provenance reveal and query provenance how work flow products were derived from inputs via programs and services organize intermediate and final data products as desired by users enable scientists to version share and publish their work flows 10 empower scientists who wish to automate additional programs and services themselves these functions not just data flow actors distinguish scientific work flow automation from general scientific software developments rc tim mc phillips bertram lu dsc her scientific work flows asap bertram lu dsc her automation fs to automate computational aspects of science scaling exploit and optimize machine cycle swf should make use of parallel compute resource swf should be able handle large data abstraction evolution reuse human cycle swf should be easy to reuse evolve share provenance fs should capture processing history data lineage traceable data and evolution reproducible science trident workbench vis trails es ware in mal motif catcher workflow implemented in kepler bertram lu dsc her sk hler et al improved motif detection in large sequence sets with random sampling in kepler workflow icc sw 2012 data curation work flows here using kepler bertram lu dsc her yes scripts are can be work flows too interactive visualization try yes workflow org cpr ov family of specifications modeling provenance analysis and rdf query processing satya sahoo pra veen rao is wc october 2015 bertram lu dsc her atleast remember this dont just it the retyping at the command line write script and document it or more vividly ms automate like you are going to live forever document like you are going to die tomorrow michaels per berg mcqueen
