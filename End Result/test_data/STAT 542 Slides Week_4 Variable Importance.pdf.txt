variable importance measure the importance of variable by the improvement of rss contributed by this variable at each split attribute the improvement of rss to the corresponding splitting variable for each variable accumulate its improvement of rss across the tree and then averaged overall the tress in the forest another measure is computed from permuting oo samples for each tree tb in the forest calculate the prediction error mse for regression base do noob samples then the same is done after permuting the th predictor in the oo samples the between the two before and after permutation is then averaged overall trees and further normalized by the corresponding standard deviation if the standard deviation of the is equal to for variable then the division is not applied
