smoothing splines in regression splines lets use nc we need to choose the number and the location of knots what smoothing spline start with naive solution put knots at all the observed data points xn yn fn nn instead of selecting knots lets carryout the following ridge regression will be later minh ky fk ti where the tuning parameter is often chosen by cv next well see how smoothing splines are derived from aspect 23 roughness penalty approach lets abbe the space of all smooth functions on ab among all the functions in sab look for the minimize of the following penalized residual sum of squares rss gn xi yi xi bag 00 dx where is smoothing parameter theorem ming rss ming rss where is anc with knots at then data points nw log xi xj and xn 24 log assume let gbe smooth function on band gbe anc with knots at fx ign satisfying gx ig xii first such exists since nc with knots has nd fs so we can pick then co properly such that is 25 next we want to show that bag 00 dx bag 00 dx with equality holds if and only if gg recall that rss gn xi yi xi bag 00 dx so it is easy to conclude that if holds rss gr sg that is for any smooth function we can anc sg which matches xion then samples and whose penalized residual sum of squares is not worse than the one of so theorem follows 26 proof we will use integration by parts and the fact that is anc sh xg xg note xi for nz bag 00 dx bag 00 xh 00 dx bag 00 dx bah 00 dx bag 00 xh 00 dx bag 00 xh 00 dx bag 00 dh xh xg 00 baz bah xg xd xn xi xix 12 zx xi xd xn xi xix 12 xxi xi 027
