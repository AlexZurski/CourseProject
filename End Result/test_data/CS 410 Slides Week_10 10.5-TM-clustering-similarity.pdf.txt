text clustering similarity based approaches department of computer science university of illinois at urbana champaign overview what is text clustering why text clustering how to do text clustering generative probabilistic models similarity based approaches how to evaluate clustering results similarity based clustering general idea explicitly define similarity function to measure similarity between find an optimal partitioning of data to maximize intra group similarity and minimize inter group similarity two strategies for obtaining optimal clustering progressively construct hierarchy of clusters hierarchical clustering bottom up agglom erat ive gradually group similar objects into larger clusters top down divisive gradually partition the data into smaller clusters clustering eg means similarity based clustering methods many general clustering methods are available two representative methods hierarchical agglom erat ive clustering hack means agglom erat ive hierarchical clustering given similarity function to measure similarity between two objects gradually group similar objects together in bottom up fashion to form hierarchy stop when some stopping criterion is met variations different ways to compute group similarity based on individual object similarity similarity induced structure how to compute group similarity three popular methods given two groups and single link algorithms similarity of the closest pair complete link algorithms similarity of the farthest pair average link algorithms average of similarity of all pairs group similarity illustrated single link algorithm complete link algorithm average link algorithm comparison of single link complete link and average link single link individual decision sensitive to outliers complete link individual decision sensitive to outliers average linkgroup decision insensitive to outliers which one is the best it depends on what you need 10 means clustering represent each text object as term vector and assume similarity function defined on two objects start with randomly selected vectors and assume they are the centro ids of clusters initial tentative clustering assign every vector to cluster whose centro id is the closest to the vector re compute the centro id for each cluster based on the newly assigned vectors in the cluster repeat this process until the similarity based objective function ie within cluster sum of squares converges to local minimum very similar to clustering with em for mixture model initialization step difference step difference summary of clustering methods model based approaches mixture model uses an implicit similarity function model clustering bias complex generative models can discover complex structures prior can be leveraged to further customize the clustering algorithm however no easy way to directly control the similarity measure similarity based approaches allows for direct and flexible specification of similarity objective function to be optimized is not always clear both approaches can generate both term clusters and doc clusters 11
