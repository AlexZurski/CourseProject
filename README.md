CS410 Course Project by Alex Zurawski

Documentation can be found the "Helpful Documents" file.

To try the search engine developed using the test data, download "End Results" and run 'search_engine.exe' or 'search_engine.py' in a terminal.

To build your own search engine, download "Reproduce Results" and follow the instructions in the documentation.

Note: before recording the video, I modified the data in Reproduce Results. If you just run the commands in the video without editing any data, the search engine created will be the same as the one in "End Results."
