text clustering evaluation department of computer science university of illinois at urbana champaign overview what is text clustering why text clustering how to do text clustering generative probabilistic models similarity based approaches how to evaluate clustering results any two objects can be similar depending on how you look at the mauser must define the perspective bias assessing similarity basis for evaluation direct evaluation of text clusters question to answer how close are the system generated clusters to the ideal clusters generated by humans evaluation procedure given test set have humans to create an ideal clustering result ie use system to produce clusters from the same test set quantify the similarity between the system generated clusters and the gold standard clusters similarity can be measured from multiple perspectives eg purity normalized mutual information measure indirect evaluation of text clusters question to answer how useful are the clustering results for the intended applications evaluation procedure create test set for the intended application to quantify the performance of any system for this application choose baseline system to compare with add clustering algorithm to the baseline system compare the performance of the clustering system and the baseline in terms of any performance measure for the application summary of text clustering text clustering is an unsupervised general text mining technique to obtain an overall picture of the text content exploring textdata discover interesting clustering structures in textdata many approaches are possible strong clusters tend to show up no matter what method used effectiveness of method highly depends on whether the desired clustering bias is captured appropriately either through using the right generative model or the right similarity function deciding the optimal number of clusters is generally difficult problem for any method due to the unsupervised nature evaluation of clustering results can be done both directly and indirectly suggested reading manning chris dpr bha karr agha vanand in rich sch tze introduction to information retrieval cambridge cambridge university press 2007 chapter 167
