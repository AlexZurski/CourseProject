foundations of data curation review data curation what is it data science data curation data analytics data science has two components data curation ensuring that data can be efficiently and reliably found and used data analytics employing specific techniques to extract knowledge from data data curation is concerned primarily with the management of data in order to better support the analysis of data data curation is the larger part of data science not only is data curation essential for reliable efficient analysis but most of the cost associated with using data is by far in curation not analysis and most of the workforce needs are also by far in curation not analysis ask any data manager in industry will tell you it is curator al work where they make the largest investment of money staff time and effort areas of curator al activities collection support the collection and acquisition of data and documentation of that throughout list organization employ an appropriate data model and use appropriate standards storage support reliable and effective storage preservation ensure that data will be understandable and useable in the future discoverability support the ability to search for and locate relevant data access support the ability to retrieve and distributed at workflow support the ability to systematize data work flows identification support the ability to identify authenticate and validate data integration support integration of data from different sources using different data models reformatting support reformatting for use by different tools or to match new format standards reproducibility support ability to reproduce results ensuring scientific validity sharing support sharing data between researchers teams andinstitutions communication support representation publishing and visualization that provide insight provenance support identifying what inputs and calculations are responsible for data values modification support management of corrections and updates compliance ensure compliance to legal regulatory and local policy requirements security ensure that data is secure from tampering or inappropriate access and distribution methods of curator al action five categories standout as particularly important analysis to determine needs develop relevant data models and metadata and reformat corrector update data documentation to record essential information typically via metadata system design and implementation to support all data curator al activities to support the generation and use of data documentation and processing documentation policy to specify objectives procedures practices and formats process to ensure success and efficiency by managing the development of appropriate organizational units and roles providing training advocating for change and managing curator al activities
