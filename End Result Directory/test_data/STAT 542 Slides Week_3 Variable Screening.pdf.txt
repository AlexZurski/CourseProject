greedy algorithms fast but only return local optimal solution which might be good enough in practice backward start with the full model and sequentially delete predictors until the score does not improve forward start with the null model and sequentially add predictors until the score does not improve stepwise consider both deleting and adding one predictor at each stage what if pn 10 variable screening when pn stepwise starting with the full model cannot be used then we can apply the following screening procedure to pick model as the starting point for stepwise simple screening procedure rank the predictors by the absolute value of their marginal correlation with keep the top predictors eg kn such simple screening procedure is likely to miss some important variables which hopefully could be added back by the stepwise procedure 11
