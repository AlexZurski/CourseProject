how much harder it is when much of the benefit accrues to others test our code add metadata to datasets use standards backup our files avoid transformations at the command line etc etc often the benefits seems indirect and elusive and we can convince ourselves it is unnecessary evident and no need to test it we were careful and no need to backup an earlier version this one is better
