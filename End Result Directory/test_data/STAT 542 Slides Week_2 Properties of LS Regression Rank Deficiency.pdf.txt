rank when deriving tx ty we assume the rank of isp sox tx exists what frank xp rank xp atleast one column of is redundant ie it can be reproduced by linear combinations of the other column six size in sq ft size in sq meter six of population above age 75 of population below age 18 of population below between 18 and 75 rank rank is not serious issue the linear subspace cx spanned by the columns of is wand therefore is wand can be computed due to rank is not unique ii nrl sc on tsn means rank you can still use the returned model to do prediction xn 20 bbbb bb 1212121 cccccc rank rank is not serious issue the linear subspace cx spanned by the columns of is wand therefore is wand can be computed due to rank is not unique ii nrl sc on tsn means rank you can still use the returned model to do prediction xn 20 bbbb bb 1212121 cccccc
