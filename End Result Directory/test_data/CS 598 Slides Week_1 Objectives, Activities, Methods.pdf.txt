objectives activities methods university of illinois at urbana champaign the data curation objective data curation is concerned with all aspects of the management of data in order to efficiently and reliably support the analysis of data and enable reuse overtime areas of curator al activities collection support the collection and acquisition of data organization employ an appropriate data model and use appropriate standards storage support reliable and effective storage preservation ensure that data will be understandable and useable in the future discoverability support the ability to search for and locate relevant data access support the ability to retrieve and distributed at workflow support the ability to systematize data work flows identification support the ability to identify authenticate and validate data integration support integration of data from different sources using different data models reformatting support reformatting for use by different tools or to match new format standards reproducibility support ability to reproduce results ensuring scientific validity and reliability sharing support sharing data between researchers teams andinstitutions communication support representation publishing and visualization that provide insight provenance support identifying what inputs processes and calculations are responsible for data values modification support management of corrections and updates compliance ensure compliance to legal regulatory and local policy requirements security ensure that data is secure from tampering or inappropriate access and distribution closer look now lets take look at each of the areas collection support the collection and acquisition of data includes support for eg coordination of instrument calibration protocols procedures collection area division interview transcription etc of particular importance recording information as metadata related to collection activity so that all relevant aspects of context are available later to support full understanding authentication and provenance organization employ an appropriate data model and use appropriate standards determine an appropriate data model and schema use abstraction and in direction to manage data identify and use any relevant standards for both syntax and semantics of particular importance document schema attributes including specifying data types and constraints document all changes to schemas maintain metadata for schema changes storage support reliable and effective storage select storage strategies that proved the right mix of reliability security and access preservation ensure that data will be understandable and useable in the future maintain documented preservation strategy this includes not just bit sequence preservation and syntax documentation but also the documentation of semantics for data elements and the generation and preservation of all metadata needed to ensure that the data is useable and understandable and can be authenticated and audited for provenance execute that strategy with discipline documenting all actions taken discoverability support the ability to search for and locate relevant data develop metadata to support searching for and finding relevant data in relevant formats support searching that provide relevance ranking and recommends related datasets access support the ability to retrieve and distributed at maintain systems tools and metadata that support the efficient and reliable retrieval and distribution of data add metadata describing file formats where appropriate control access appropriately and maintain data on distribution and access workflow support the ability to systematize work with data the processing of data should be carried out well designed modular system of transformations the role of each module should be documented the execution of workflow should be documented as well to the greatest extent possible documentation should be generated automatically and should itself be both machine readable and executable specifically well maintained scripts should be developed and used to document as well as executed at transformations identification support the ability to identify authenticate and validate data identifier systems must be carefully designed attention must be given to what conceptually is being identified and to the method of identification related entities such as the data abstractly and the same data represented in different formats must be both precisely distinguished and precisely related version control for format changes corrections etc must be implemented authentication the data is in fact the data it claims to be and validation the schema constraints syntax and semantics are met are both fundamental integration support integration of data from different sources using different data models both variations in syntax and data element semantics must be accommodated if data from multiple sources is to be combined and related to solve real world problems use schema alignment and cross walking techniques to integrate data document integration strategies in detail so that any con flat ion data loss etc is noted reformatting support reformatting for use by different tools or to match new format standards data must frequently be reformatted in order to support new tools new versions of existing tools or to meet new format standards reformatting must be documented and any changes in semantics or meaning must be identified reproducibility support ability to reproduce results ensuring scientific validity and reliability data curation for reproducibility includes documenting not only data collection and management but also documenting processing and analysis sharing support sharing data between researchers teams andinstitutions there are many obstacles to data sharing ranging from formats to lack of documentation to concerns about misuse or misunderstanding data curation must address these typically with policies documentation metadata and interoperable systems communication support representation publishing and visualization that provide insight to be useful data must be presented in forms that provide insight such as scientific visualization and integrated clearly and efficiently into the full lifecycle of scientific work which includes scientific publishing related communication issues are relevant to other data curation activities in entertainment documentation services etc here data curation overlaps with interface design provenance support identifying what inputs calculations and actions are responsible for data values when one data set or view is derived from another reliable use and understanding requires that the inputs calculations and actions responsible for data values can be identified modification support management of corrections and updates data must be updated and corrected this must be supported and managed so that errors are not introduced but so that the changes overtime can be tracked and audited compliance ensure compliance to legal regulatory and local policy requirements the issues here range from intellectual property rights to regulations regarding the privacy of medical financial and personal information security ensure that data is secure from tampering or inappropriate access and distribution this will involve methods for controlling access and determining user identity and privileges as well as data identity authentication and validation methods of curator al action analysis to determine needs and develop relevant data models and metadata and reformat corrector update data documentation to record essential information typically via metadata system design and implementation to support all data curator al activities to support the generation and use of data documentation and processing documentation policy to specify objectives procedures practices and formats process to ensure success and efficiency by managing the development of appropriate organizational units and roles providing training advocating for change and managing curator al activities
