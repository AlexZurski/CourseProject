what is data cu ration university of illinois at urbana champaign what is data curation definitions of data curation science vs practice of data curation data analytics values data curation values importance of data curation relative size employment of data curation vs data analytics our definition of data science again data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation management analysis and communication of data focusing particularly on the application of computational methods to digital data the data science objective extracting useful knowledge from data data science data curation data analytics data science has two components data curation ensuring that data can be efficiently and reliably found and used data analytics employing specific techniques to extract knowledge from data data curation is concerned primarily with the management of data in order to better support the analysis of data it includes among many other things acquisition and collection modeling workflow provenance validity and integrity metadata preservation integration retrieval reuse policy standards identifiers format conversions processing levels supporting reproducibility etc but the boundary is not sharp one data cu ration the illinois definition from wikipedia according to the university of illinois school of information sciences data cu ration is the active and ongoing management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship science and education cu ration activities enable data discovery and retrieval maintain quality add value and provide for reuse overtime data cu ration wikipedia retrieved may 12017 original source an educational program on data cu rational science technology section conference crag in melissa heid or np bryan palmer carol el smith linda 2007 science of vs practice of the science of data curation research and development on new methods of data management and used rawson mathematical and engineering methods but also on methods from social science law economics and other disciplines the practice of data curation the use and adaptation of data management methods to meet user needs and support data analytics once again not sharp distinction but are alone nonetheless the same distinction can be made for data analytics data science values data analytics values extraction should be novel fast precise accurate data curation values data should be efficient and reliable find able useable legal there by supporting novelty speed precision accuracy importance of data cu ration where real world interdisciplinary challenges are concerned curator al problems are acute large amounts of rapidly changing data often heterogeneous in nature and developed by different scientific communities must be found retrieved authenticated reformatted integrated with other data and managed for effective use and demonstrably reliable even after processing and preparation importance of data cu ration supporting analysis discovery and use is an enormous challenge it involves the complex management of large scale data storage and preservation creation of metadata and tools for retrieval and context documentation preparation of computationally accessible documentation of provenance and work flow conducting reliable format conversions to support new tools and applications the management of identifiers and validity checks that accommodate format changes the integration of related data elements from substantially different data sources and more importance of data cu ration without successful data cu ration successful data analysis is not possible it would be prohibitively expensive and and dangerously unreliable data curation is the larger part of data science not only is data curation essential for reliable efficient analysis but most of the cost associated with using data is by far in curation not analysis and most of the workforce needs are also by far in curation not analysis ask any data manager in industry will tell you it is curator al work where they make the largest investment of money staff time and effort
