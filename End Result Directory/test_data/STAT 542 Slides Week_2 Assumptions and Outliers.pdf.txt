line assumptions for linear regression il fx ey xx is assumed to be linear function of this is not really an assumption but restriction if the truth is not linear function then regression just returns us the best linear approximation of fi in error terms at all is are ii dn 02 can be relaxed to be uncorrelated with mean zero and constant variance this assumption is related to the objective function nun weighted sum of the squared errors at all is if the errors have unequal variances heteros ced asti city or correlated then we should use objective function in assumptions on xs but to achieve good performance we would like is to be uniformly sampled outliers outlier test based on leave one out prediction error let bethel estimate of based on samples excluding the it sample xi yi the nyi xt ii some normalizing term 01 if it sample is not an outlier datasets from real applications are usually large in terms of both and do not recommend to test outliers why need to adjust for multiple comparison cannot detect cluster of outliers but do recommend to do some of the following run the summary command in to know the range of each variable apply log square root or other transformations on right skewed predictors and yi apply winsor iz ation to remove the of extreme values
