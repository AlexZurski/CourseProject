what is data science university of illinois at urbana champaign what is data science definitions of data science our definition of data science importance of data science who are data scientists an nice ambiguity science with data or science of data research vs practice data science data curation data analytics some definitions of data science work concerned with the collection preparation analysis visualization management and preservation of large collections of information data scientists play active roles in four related areas data architecture data acquisition data analysis and data archiving data science is an applied activity and data scientists serve the needs and solve the problems of data users jeffrey stanton introduction to data science 2013 the science of planning for acquisition management analysis of inference and discovery from data final report from stats nsf support for the statistical sciences at nsf subcommittee iain johnstone fred roberts co chairs july 182014 other terms related to data science other terms related to data science are informatics data mining knowledge discovery science cyber infrastructure data analytics data curation etc as well as of course the colloquial phrase big data our definition of data science data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation management analysis and communication of data focusing particularly on the application of computational methods to digital data the data science objective extracting useful knowledge from data the importance of data science today several things have combined to create this revolution vast quantities of digital data from wide variety of sources and often arriving in realtime stunning advances new analytical strategies and computational methods easy to use powerful analysis tools high speed global communications access to distributed high performance computing from almost anywhere in the world large community of experts in the new strategies for data management and analysis the importance of data science today those things create exciting new opportunities for major advances in many industries professions and disciplines including medicine health engineering defense safety agriculture business the arts community services government services and more data science the with of ambiguity existing definitions of data science reflect an ambiguity in the phrase data science specifically is data science to be understood as the science of data or as science with data wikipedia has defined data science as the study of the general iz able extraction of knowledge from data wikipedia 2013142 the extraction of knowledge from data wikipedia 201415 the literal difference is clear in doing data science is doing research on computational methods that is developing new tools and techniques studying those tools and techniques and studying their applications in doing data science is using data science methods to do research in other fields genetics medicine engineering marketing etc our definition deliberately avoids the issue again data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation management analysis and communication of data focusing particularly on the application of computational methods to digital data the data science objective extracting useful knowledge from data data science data curation data analytics data science has two components data curation ensuring that data can be efficiently and reliably found and used data analytics employing specific techniques to extract knowledge from data data curation is concerned primarily with the management of data in order to better support the analysis of data it includes among many other things acquisition and collection modeling workflow provenance validity and integrity metadata preservation integration retrieval reuse policy standards identifiers format conversions processing levels supporting reproducibility etc
