standards some standard standards maneuvers standards are built on standards which are built on standards which are there are standards and there are meta standards and for more reasons than one being nonstandard can be standardized too standards are built on standards take close look at almost any standard xml pub json etc you will see that it is based on other standards it can specify xml schema and xml schema in turn doesnt need to define its own character encoding it can specify unicode and soon sub setting ie only portions of the subordinate standards are allowed this can make production and validation complicated but simplify things for downstream applications meta standards imagine trying to get everyone to agree on document markup languages hall it be latex or scribe or troff sora new one so how about standardize not markup languages but on how we define markup languages ie how we indicate what our tags are what patterns or use are legitimate etc and do it with process able formal grammar so schemas can be validated and configure applications we can still keep trying to standardize the language itself and we may succeed eg tei jats etc but atleast we get something important very important and necessary in any case by going meta and that of course is why we have standards like xml standardizing being nonstandard standards maybe extended in standard ways eg the xml internal subset lets elements and attributes be added to schema completely nonstandard constructs maybe used for instance one can use an escaped segment to have the processor skip validation departures from standards can be graceful your apps can deal with it eg the in famous blink tag that was not in the html standard instead document it so everyone knows what it means or does standards wishing to support such departures extensions can specify that and above are required for conformance any nonstandard construct must be mapped to standard construct that approximates the meaning of the nonstandard element or is an appropriate alternative action an approach used in the pub standard international digital publishing federation
