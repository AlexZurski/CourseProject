degree of freedom of ridge regression can we say the complexity of the ridge regression model which return sap dim co vector ridge isp although ridge isp dim the ridge regression doesnt seem to use the full strength of the co variate due to the shrinkage for example if is very large the df of the resulting ridge regression model should be close to if is we are back to linear regression model with co variate so the df of ridge regression should be some number between and decreasing rt 25 one way to measure the degree of freedom df of method is fn xi cory yi suppose method returns then value as yann where is ann by matrix not depending ony of course it depends on is the nd fn xi cory iy in xi ii tra for example for linear regression model with pc owe all agree that the degree of freedom isp if using the formula above we have df tr hp yl shy which also gives usd fp 26 for ridge regression we have ridges where xx tx xt px jd ju uti we can the df of ridge regression to be df trs px jd when the tuning parameter ie no regular iz ation fp when goes to df goes to from other variables election methods the df for ridge regression can vary continuously from top 27
