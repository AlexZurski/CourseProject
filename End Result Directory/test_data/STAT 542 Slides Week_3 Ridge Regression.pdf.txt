ridge regression how to derive the solution ridge understand the shrinkage of ridge why we want to do shrinkage how to quantify the dimension or df of ridge regression model how to select the tuning parameter seer page 14 in ridge regression the criterion we want to minimize is ty xt the solution ridge tx ty later well see that ridge co can be computed for all using sv compared to theol estimate ls tx ty the ridge regression solution adds an on negative constant to the diagonal of tx so we can take the in version even if tx is not of full rank and it was the initial motivation for ridge regression hoe rl and kennard 197015
