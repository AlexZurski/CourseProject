how to build tree three elements where to split when to stop how to predict at each leaf node prediction at leaf nodes each leaf node corresponds to region rm contains some samples assign the prediction for leaf node to be the average of the response variable fxx cm if mgm in cm xi xi my cm cm average of is whose xi rm where to split split is denoted by js split the data into two parts based on whether var values for each split split criterion js deduction of rss for regression trees are built in top down greedy fashion start with the root try all possible variables and all possible split values and pick the best split ie the split having the best value now data are divided into the left node and right node repeat this procedure in each node for each variable sort then values from samples and chooses to be middle point of two adjacent values so at most possible values for goodness of split js for regression tree we look at the deduction of rss if we split samples at node tinto tr and tl js rss th rss tr rss tli where rs st xxi ty ict cta ve fyi xi tg note that js is always positive if we split the data into two group seven randomly unless the mean of the left node and the one of right node are the same issues split categorical predictors for categorical predictor with levels there are 11 possible partitions of them labels into two groups however for regression with square error the computation order them levels by their mean values of and then split the categorical variable as if it were an ordered predictor there are only potential splits issues missing predictor values discard any observation with missing values serious depletion of the training set splitting criteria are evaluated on non missing observations once split js is determined what to do with observations missing xj 10 find surrogate variables that can predict the binary outcome xj and xj using one split tree rank those surrogate variables along with the blind rule go with majority any observation that is missing xj is then with the surrogate variable or if missing that the second surrogate variable or the blind rule is used and etc 11 when to stop simple one stop splitting at anode if the gain from any split is less than some pre sp threshold but this is shortsighted another strategy grow large tree and then prune it ie cut some branches 12
