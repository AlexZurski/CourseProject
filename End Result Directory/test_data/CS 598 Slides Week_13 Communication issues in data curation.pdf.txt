communication and data curation communication issues in data cu ration as we have seen communication is central to almost every area of data cu ration and is itself an area of data cu ration scientific communication of data and the results of data analysis is an essential part of science technology and scholarship with effects in two directions of course more data and more data analysis is good thing but the increase is causing crisis in scientific communication communication and the data curation as we have seen communication is central to almost every area of data curation and it itself an independent area areas of curator al activities collection support the collection and acquisition of data organization employ an appropriate data model and use appropriate standards storage support reliable and effective storage preservation ensure that data will be understandable and useable in the future discoverability support the ability to search for and locate relevant data access support the ability to retrieve and distributed at workflow support the ability to systematize data work flows identification support the ability to identify authenticate and validate data integration support integration of data from different sources using different data models reformatting support reformatting for use by different tools or to match new format standards reproducibility support ability to reproduce results ensuring scientific validity sharing support sharing data between researchers teams andinstitutions communication support representation publishing and visualization that provide insight provenance support identifying what inputs and calculations are responsible for data values modification support management of corrections and updates compliance ensure compliance to legal regulatory and local policy requirements security ensure that data is secure from tampering or inappropriate access and distribution our definition of data science again data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation management analysis and communication of data focusing in particularly on the application of computational methods to digital data the data science objective extracting useful knowledge from data methods of curator al action there are many methods and techniques employed to achieve the objectives just listed but five categories standout as particularly important analysis to determine needs and develop relevant data models and metadata and reformat corrector update data documentation to record essential information typically via metadata system design and implementation to support all data curator al activities to support the generation and use of data documentation and processing documentation policy to specify objectives procedures practices and formats process to ensure success and efficiency by managing the development of appropriate organizational units and roles providing training advocating for change and managing curator al activities what we will take up next ok communication is relevant to many aspects of data curation but we have particular focus this week scientific and technical communication particularly journal literature where scientific results are reported scientific communication is how data gets noticed image from science 20 repositories time for change in scholarly communication massimiliano as santee tal lib magazine 2015 scientific and technical communication is critical part of the data lifecycle with effects flowing both ways from the research process and back into the research process after all if the results of analyzing data are not communicated then what the point of it all the crisis but scientific and technical publishing is in crisis as well see in the next video
