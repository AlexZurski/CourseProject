xml schema dtd example of xml processing xml tools xml languages xml an xml document uses defined set of delimiters with arbitrary element names and attribute value pairs to nest spans of text well formed xml document fits formal grammar along with other constraints that ensures the document can be parsed as tree by an xml parser nba well formed xml document need not have schema that defines the element vocabulary and grammar it may use arbitrary element attribute and value names and arrange text objects in anyway that does not violate the tree data structure the two main things in the xml world schemas such as document type definitions dtd one for each document type class category genre defines markup language for document structures by specifying its vocabulary and syntax grammar what elements can occur in documents of particular type what patterns these elements may form what other information can be included about these elements document instances particular documents marked up with markup language that meets well formed ness constraints and perhaps also meets the constraints of relevant schema well formed xml document anthology poem heading the sick rose heading stanza line

respect to some schema if it conforms to the declarations in that schema which is to say matches the grammar and other constraints nothing out of place nothing missingno attributes with values the wrong type no references that failand soon validating parser applies an xml schema to an xml document and determines whether or not the document conforms to the constraints specified in the schema all valid xml documents are well formed but not viceversa xml processing dtd declarations document instance other information eg queries stylesheet templates xml parser xml application eg database

languages and interchange there are an enormous number of xml markup languages see https enwikipedia org wiki list of xml markup languages most of these languages are not for text but are interchange and preservation formats for structured data xml is an important preservation format it use of simple ascii text within line tags can be parsed without schema and if schema is available can be validated ensuring correct grammar nothing missing nothing out of place and data typing
