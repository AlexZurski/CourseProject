  an ontology for data concepts an ontology for data concepts the preliminaries over we now present our ontology of data concepts this ontology generalizes andre factors rbr accommodating both collapsing middle entity types multiplying middle entity types and illuminating the fundamental role of both standards and human intentional it recall why the middle two entity types seemed to collapse how about rbr linguistic representation entity type work proposition proposition expression sentence symbol structure manifestation encoding symbol structure item inscription patterned matter energy propositions symbol structure symbol structure matter energy recall why the two middle entity types seem to multiply snow is white proposition can be expressed by sentence can be encoded by snow is white characters which can be encoded by snow is white glyphs which can be encoded by 83110111 integers which can be encoded by numerals which can be encoded by 010100110110111001101111 binary octets but how many levels are there here really there can be any number the situation we have an indefinite number of symbolic encodings not just one or two the first level seems to be similar to afr br expression the rest seem to be either encoding an expression or encoding an encoding taking liberties here to make point recall our recursive solution sentence is symbol structure that expresses proposition an encoding is symbol structure that encodes sentence or encoding ok here we go an ontology for data alt text drum roll please the basic representation model orf rbr refactored instantiation level semantic level syntax level encoding levels based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al for example propositions expressed by rdf triples encoded by rdf xml encoded by unicode characters encoded by utf bitstream inscribed in actual raid array state all mm propositional interpretive frames 11 how do expressing encoding and inscribing actually happen part of the answer information processing standards eg those from iso ietf cn iso etc within data representation and processing realms these codify things like html integer 101 encodes latin unicode ascii octet 01100101 encodes integer 101 unicode ascii these include simple mappings as above but also specifications of syntax and semantics for data representation languages in addition natural language prose descriptions are also important and difficult to interpret precisely we call all these things interpretative frames dub in wicket sacchi 2011 semantic level syntax level encoding levels interpretative frames the circumstances that actually establish these relationships ie standards policies etc propositional based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al instantiation level also needed human intentional it instantiation level semantic level syntax level encoding levels based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al interpretative frames propositional standards policies etc are inert unless they are intended by people to be applied so we also need beliefs intentions practices etc the importance of human intentional it human agreement and intentional it is particularly prominent in the digital world in the form of standards and policies but standards and policies alone are not enough the circumstances that establish and sustain the contingent relationships indicated in the model also involve and essentially involve the actual collective beliefs intentions and expectations of engineers programmers and end users 14 ie collective intentional it cf john searle instantiation level semantic level syntax level encoding levels based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al propositional interpretative frames
