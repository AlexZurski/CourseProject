what is data preservation the common definitions are misleading the problem what exactly is preserved our answer nothing is preserved our definition you ll see why the definition is important some common definitions of data preservation preservation the professional discipline of protecting materials by minimizing chemical and physical deterioration and damage to minimize the loss of information and to extend the life of cultural property society of american archivists digital preservation the active management of digital content overtime to ensure ongoing access us library of congress recall our data ontology now ask yourself in successful preservation scenario what exactly is preserved what exactly is preserved no really what the physical thing maybe things in the patterned matter energy entity type that would be actual disks thumb drives hard drives raid arrays etc sure we often do need to take care of these absolutely but overtime preservation of data or information maybe successful even as the individual physical media disappear or become inoperable so the continuing existence and integrity of some physical object is not necessary for preservation propositional content maybe things belonging proposition content entity type that would be that data or information itself eg observations claims assertions facts etc but do those things really need preservation consider this assertion 100000 people live in zip code area 61820 why does its preservation require our intervention it cant crumble oxidize dissolve mold etc such things cannot decay and so cannot be the object of preservation atleast not in the original and narrow sense of preservation symbol structures maybe things of the symbol structure entity type but symbol structures also dont need preservation consider up 61820 cb population 100000 this is repeatable sequence of tokens or characters it also cannot oxidize fall apart dissolve get moldy etc and so it also does not need our help surviving the vicissitudes of nature and in any case we often support preservation of data by deliberately changing symbol structures eg replacing an obsolete language or format with different or newer one but if those things then so what is preserved we just observed that it cant be any of the things in our data ontology the answer is nothing is preserved or perhaps less paradoxically nothing is preserved data preservation is not about preserving data preserving physical objects in the traditional sense of preservation is part of data preservation but only part preservation of physical media must occur for some intervals of time but data preservation can also take place even when particular media decay and indeed often we deliberately discard media as part of data preservation strategy preserving propositions assertions etc and symbol structures encodings is not part of data preservation all because they cannot decay and moreover their continued existence does not ensure preservation preservation is not about preserving anything data preservation is not about preserving the existence of objects it is about communication with the future the best simple definition is ensuring reliable communication with the future 21 reagan moore towards theory of digital preservation the international journal of digital cu ration 20082 simone sacchi what do we mean by preserving digital information towards sound conceptual foundations for digital stewardship doctoral dissertation university of illinois at urbana champaign 20158 the definition expanded preservation is not about preservation preservation is ensuring reliable communication with the future more exactly preservation actions are intended to ensure that future researchers or other users will come into possession of physical media and encodings from which they will correctly recognize the originally intended propositional content and from which they will be justified in believing that this propositional content is in fact the intended propositional content this can be adapted to more explicitly accommodate software agents and automatic processing the key thing is that the process is reliable all interpretations are correct and justified why is this important because when you emphasize that data preservation is ensuring reliable communication with the future you see that it is primarily about understanding and credibility not the physical persistence of objects and that focuses our attention on preservation actions that ensure understanding and credibility actions that are too often neglected 10
