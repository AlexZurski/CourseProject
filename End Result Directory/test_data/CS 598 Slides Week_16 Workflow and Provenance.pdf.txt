workflow and provenance anything profound and the cool slides is from bertram lu dsc her everything else is from re near what is data workflow much of our work with data especially in scientific applications consists in transforming one data set into another data curation and data workflow data curation is concerned with transformations in two ways managing and documenting transformations involved in data analytics performing transformation to realize data curation objectives preservation integration format conversion etc kinds of data transformations transformations where input and output datasets are identical in propositional content transformation to different data description language or new version of language transformation to different serialization or new version of serialization transformations where the input data set mathematically contains the output data set transformation to subset matching specific conditions eg simple queries transformation to logically or mathematically entailed data of the same kind eg summaries statistics visualization transformations where the input data set scientifically contains in the output data set transformation to scientifically entailed data of the same kind here the resulting data set typically contains information different in kind eg data set about air pressure is transformed to data set about altitudes

designed organized work flows support efficiency reliability modi fi ability reuse reproducibility computational provenance the heart of computational provenance what data was used what calculations were performed and also what in the world exactly happened just now why is provenance important access to provenance information supports understanding reliability reproducibility trust attribution and credit discovery and reuse of data tools and algorithms prospective vs retrospective provenance ludaescher prospective specification the workflow scenario retrospective generated data on the execution of the workflow scenario scripts are or can be workflow try yes workflow org atleast remember this dont just it the retyping at the command line write script and document it for crying out loud communication scientific communication is how data gets noticed image from science 20 repositories time for change in scholarly communication massimiliano as santee tal lib magazine 2015 scientific and technical communication is critical part of the data lifecycle with effects flowing both ways from the research process and back into the research process after all if the results of analyzing data are not communicated then what the point of it all the crisis but scientific and technical publishing is in crisis problem caused by data and that can be addressed with data as well see
