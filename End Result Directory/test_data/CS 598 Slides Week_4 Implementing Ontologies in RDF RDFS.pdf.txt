  implementing on to logie in rdf rdf university of illinois at urbana champaign implementing on to logie in rdf rdf the rdf graph model for predication rdf schema for defining simple ontology an example our data model diagram is now completed rdf rdf owl today on to logie are often expressed in rdf or owl these are powerful logic based languages designed to be read processed by software including in ferenc ing systems rdf resource description framework simple model for predication can be serialized in different languages rdf rdf schema basic schema concepts that can be used to define schemas for rdf instances owl web ontology language general schema concepts for more advanced schemas resource description framework rdf gives general model for describing things by saying that something has particular property with particular value these descriptions are intended to be processed by software and shared across applications and computing environments without loss of meaning rdf can be expressed as graph or serialized in various ways including xml rdf data model the basic abstract structure of single descriptive assertion in rdf is triple an ordered set of these three elements subject thing predicate property object value rdf graph lang ague the representation of triple in the rdf graph language an rdf graph is collection of such triples nb where er has distinct constructs for both attributes and relationships rdf uses single construct the predicate property for both after all under the hood they are both just two place fol predication sr xy as we have seen subject object predicate example to express in rdf simple bibliographic description using dublin core identifier 128935 title the intellectual foundation of information organization creator elaine

text but that picture is pref rbr the rdf graph on the previous slide is of course not consistent with rbr to adapt that description to the rbr conceptual model we need system of related classes and properties that is we need schema the sort of thing ner diagram is schema language that interoperate with rdf that would be rdf schema rdf schema rdf schema is schema language for defining rdf vocabularies the rdf schema language itself uses rdf triples as its syntax it needs some vocabulary for its own that is it needs some fundamental properties and classes that it can use to define rdf vocabularies for specific domains see the next slide what follows is largely based on the rdf vocabulary for rbr published here http voc borg rbr core fr brin rdf classes item manifestation expression
