  the solution descriptive markup subtitle goes here university of illinois at urbana champaign the solution descriptive markup its the same solution the problem again the solution descriptive markup how it emerged how it works and delivers the goods why it works our example recall the problems we noticed with this approach to organizing text input file contains this data pa odd font times size 14 it ce in 55 sk pak next to include the sick rose after processing the output is rendered like this the sick rose the first improvement from the us government printing office in the 1960 macro is defined to abbreviate formatting commands format 17 df pa odd font times size 14 it ce in 55 sk psk pak next to include the macro is used in the input format 17 the sick rose this helps bit why but not as much as it might help why problem although format 17 helps it doesnt go far enough since format 17 abstracts to typographic look it can be used wherever you want that look titles captions extract labels so what might be even better dont identify the look identify the component itself format 17 the sick rose format 17 fig ate arose the sick rose fig ate arose much better improvement macro is defined to identify the logical component of the text itself not the the intended processing or the appearance of the that component titled fp odd font times size 14 it ce in 55 sk psk pak next to include the macro is used in the input file like this title the sick rose abstraction from storage consider this text an example of the tea rose is http www example or grose hybrid tea pink 42 its mouthful and what if the image moves entity name is defined to abbreviate location rose 42 df http www example or grose hybrid tea pink 42 the entity name is used in the input an example of the tea rose is rose 42 after processing the output is rendered like this an example of the tea rose is again abstraction and in direction again our solution is abstraction in explicitly identifying recurring logical objects like titles we abstract away from the varied and varying details of processing and storage we then exploit this abstraction by using in direction mapping object instances to storage locations mapping types of objects to processing rules achieving efficiencies and new functionality examples of text components title author date abstract section subsection sub subsection section title subsection title etc paragraph extract long quotation equation diagram footnote genre specific text components scientific article title author affiliation address date submitted date revised keywords abstract introduction methodology results discussion conclusion diagram equation plate graph chart bibliography bibliography item date play scripts act scene stage direction line character cast list poetry title author verse stanza couplet line half line also legal and financial documents such as contracts deeds licenses writs tickets receipts office documents such as project proposals monthly reports position descriptions performance evaluations other forms etc an xml example anthology poem heading the sick rose heading stanza line rose thou art sick line line the invisible worm line line that flies in the nightline line in the howling storm line stanza stanza line has found out thy bed line line of crimson joy line line and his dark secret love line line does thy life destroy line stanza poem more poems go here anthology example from the text encoding initiative other examples 14 ne xml for phylogenetic information music markup language medical markup language descriptive markup descriptive markup describes the logical components of documents it does not spec if iy processing advantages of descriptive markup authoring editing transcribing composition is simplified writing tools are supported alternative views and links facilitated publishing formatting generically specified and modified apparatus automated output device support enhanced portability maximized retrieval and analysis information retrieval supported analytical procedures supported how does this help with data curation descriptive markup makes digital documents easier to create easier to maintain easier to convert new formats new delivery software better integrated with workflow in organization better integrated with other applications and tools databases word processing templates indexes etc more accessible to varied audiences easier to accommodate different technological circumstances varying hardware operating systems browser software brands and versions both connectivity bandwidth etc easier to accommodate different perceptual abilities blindness other sight disabilities dyslexia etc
