  what is metadata what is metadata defining metadata simple definition some examples of metadata data defining metadata better definition what is metadata for the standard classification of metadata descriptive administrative structural metadata vs data what is metadata first definition the simple and most common colloquial definition is data about data what is metadata information that might be metadata metadata for data set of temperatures on the surface of the earth at sometime might include nature of data here temperatures on surface of the earth location relevant to data application eg latitude longitude altitude box when the data was recorded and where the recording equipment was located maybe in orbit what equipment was used along with what settings and calibrations the data format and schemas semantics syntax encoding any standards being used version history with who when what why for changes input datasets and algorithms involved in deriving this data set if not raw data checksum or other fixity signature identifier located in system reflecting format and content change history organization responsible and perhaps owns the data or copyright restrictions on use legal or local policy and soon the first thing to notice here is the extremely varied nature of this information and the similar variation in the implied purposes example data set metadata origin usgs

object that supports functions associated with the designated object greenberg 2003 here the concept of object includes data set what is metadata for structured data that supports functions for example metadata about data set supports mostly human oriented functions mostly machine oriented functions find potentially relevant data read data with appropriate software determine relevance eg understand exactly what the data includes and excludes visualize and display data understand and interpret data analyze data assess data quality and integrity integrate data from different sources authenticate data convertor migrate data avoid inappropriate use organized at etc etc the standard classification of metadata by function descriptive for describing are source to support things like finding understanding evaluating choosing among digital objects or data administrative technical preservation rights for decoding and rendering for long term management for describing intellectual property rights structural for relating parts of resources to one another adapted from http www ni so org apps group public download php 17446 understanding 20 metadata pdf metadata vs data first

only some data metadata what data is metadata and what data is not temperature unit instrument 315 celsius acme the rm data point temperature is 315 information that might support the use of this data point temperature of what what is the unit collected when for what purpose etc but the instrument identification might have been metadata on the entire data set and the unit designation might have been an metadata on schema ex temp unit celsius instrument acme the rm 315 ex temp often the distinction is pragmatic suppose that process was generating datasets by making 10000 observations all at the same place but over an interval of time we would probably treat time as data eg column if the data set is relational and treat place as metadata attached to the data set but if the example is reversed for time and space single point in time but varying locations in space we would probably treat time as metadata and space as data here the motivation is atleast in part reducing complexity and avoiding update anomalies and if we anticipated integration with records where both time and space information varies we would probably represent both time and space data as data ie with two separate columns in the table but is the distinction always pragmatic perhaps some features are essentially data about data for instance value related features accuracy specifications data types value constraints notation system etc data set features size of data set coverage of data set time or space intervals schemas etc more differentiation problems element anthology poem element poem title

look closely it appears that the data metadata distinction is typically based on practical considerations and not clear hard distinction nevertheless some metadata is seems clearly about data eg accuracy data type notation etc and some clearly about datasets eg size coverage owner model encoding features etc and so some metadata appears to be metadata in strict sense
