data preservation the preservation integration parallels preservation goals again preservation challenges appear isomorphic to integration challenges tracing the parallels helps us to better understand both the challenges and the required interventions preservation goals many organizations and standards have proposed classifications of preservation goals nearly statement see oclc rl working group on preservation metadata image credits unc libraries viable can be read from media render able viewable and process able understandable interpret able and longer one viable can be read correctly from media render able can be correctly viewed processed executed understandable can be correctly understood authentic table can be correctly determined to be what it purports to be identifiable can be correctly identified andre identified and more can be added of course find able conform ant etc following our own definition of preservation we would emphasize that each of these five not only must be achievable but the user must have justified confidence in the result see premis https www loc gov standards premis the data integration preservation isomorphism in many respects the challenges of data preservation are the same as the challenges of data integration only across time rather than space lets take look at data preservation through that lens we will be able to apply manythings we ve already discussed as always metadata is key instrument for achieving our objectives the role of physical media in communication with the future physical objects are essential for communication with the future because we live in world of spacetime energy matter and causality and so attending to those physical objects is necessary to ensure that communication but the individual objects involved need not persist throughout the entire temporal interval communication with the future is achieved via chain of overlapping physical objects still functionality of physical objects must be maintained during relevant intervals in the chain storage media and associated hardware drives cables etc must be protected against kinetic damage chemical decay electromagnetic insult etc as well as theft and loss for physical media the ensuring of communication is accomplished with policies and procedures the management of associated physical environments accurate complete and computer readable documentation associated digital objects apis embedded systems operating systems must also be preserved communicating encoding the decoding of every level of encoding must be reliable from reading and off media to mapping the bitstream to bytes then integers then characters or other meaningful symbolic units with utf and unicode something are easier than they were but nothing here can betaken for granted as always we ensure the communication of encoding like we ensure all communication through documentation particularly computer process able metadata that uses standard vocabularies and standard serialization syntax usually the most important role of this metadata is to indicate the various data standards being used at different levels of encoding or to indicate extensions restrictions sub setting or other modifications of standards communicating the syntax schema that identifies the structure of the data statements and documents the controlled vocabulary of attributes identifiers and values is essential this schema should be computer process able so it can be used to validate the structure of the data to supply data types and to configure processing tools and applications here again we ensure communication through documentation particularly computer process able metadata that uses standard vocabularies and standard serialization syntax and here too the most important role of this metadata is often to indicate the various data standards being used communicating the propositions this is what it is all about ensuring the reliable communication of what is being asserted all the prior attention given to media encoding and syntax helps but there is more to do the constituents of propositions are relationships and entities indicated in the controlled vocabulary for the top level logical syntax these must be identified explained documented for this formal model or ontology is useful the schema for this ontology should be computer process able so it can be used for validation data integration and management of transformation to alternative syntax es again we are ensuring communication through documentation particularly computer process able metadata with standard vocabularies and standard serialization syntax and here too the most important role of this metadata is often to indicate the various data standards being used here standard on to logie perhaps modified however at this level natural language prose will also be essential temperature location county race species such things cannot be explained by formal language alone turtles no not the rdf serialization language as with data integration documentation there is also the regress problem for data preservation as well metadata for data is itself data and must also be preserved and that will require among other things metadata for metadata where to stop is practical matter and the foundation will be natural language prose this is another reason why existing shared standards are so important they already backup mathematical formalities with natural language and their existence and use creates communities of shared understanding 10
