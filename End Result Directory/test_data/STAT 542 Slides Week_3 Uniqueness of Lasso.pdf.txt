lasso with pn when is of full rank the lasso solution the minimize of convex function over convex set is unique since the st term is strictly convex function when pn or when is not of full rank the st term is no longer strictly convex then lasso maybe unique if xs is of full rank where is selected variable set or not unique however lasso and lasso are still unique for more discussion on the uniqueness of lasso check this paper 38
