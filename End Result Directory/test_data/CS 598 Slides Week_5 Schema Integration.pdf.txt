  schema integration university of illinois at urbana champaign schema integration definition representational challenges semantic challenges homonyms synonyms overlaps missing relationships generality definition schema integration schema integration the process of merging several conceptual schemas into global conceptual schema that represents all the requirements of the application bati niet al if the approach is federation federating schema is created and mapped to individual schemas if the approach is derived combination data set single schema is created for the derived data set schema integration usually takes place at the conceptual level as indicated above or at the logical level eg relational schemas or xml schemas or even across levels egan xml schema and an ontology particularly when the distinction between logical and conceptual level is unclear two kinds of schema integration problems representational aka structural different choices about modeling constructs and integrity constraints semantic synonyms homonyms missing relationships different but related concepts etc in what follows we focus on naming problems simple naming problems synonyms and homonyms for example two schemas use different names and for the same properties two schemas use the same name for different properties once it is determined that or is the case the remedy either in meta schema for federation or the new comprehensive schema for derived combination is obvious what is hard is determining that there is in fact synonym homonym problem this might involve examining documentation interviewing schema designers and data collectors etc and of course examining the distribution of values in the data set instances themselves in all cases using background knowledge of the domain is essential but none of these are decisive synonyms homonyms homonyms synonyms administrators offices holds building offices contains client credit holds customer order places identifying client and customer as the same entity type in different schemas is called schema matching schema schema schema schema not so simple naming problem conceptual overlaps more challenging problem is when there is conceptual overlap for instance schema has an attribute name interpreted as applying to nicknames and legal names but not to aliases schema has an attribute name interpreted as applying to legal names and aliases but not nicknames like other earlier problems overlap maybe difficult to discover but it is also difficult to remedy without information loss what are the options inter schema relationships suppose one schema has the entity type county but not the entity type state another has the entity type state but not the entity type county this limits the information we can extract from these datasets adding belongs to to the integrating schema and mapping of counties to states will allow instance data in the first to be connected to states as well as counties nb these relationships are not represented in either schema they must be inferred county state schema schema belongs to inter schema relationship adapted from bati nic lenz erin im and nava the sb 1986 comparative analysis of methodologies for database schema integration acm computing surveys 184 doi 1011452763327634 generality variation schema has an entity type vehicle but noway to indicate kinds of vehicles schema has an entity type for motorcycle but no entity type for vehicle motorcycle is or course proper subset and so subclass of vehicle simple solution would be to generalize motorcycle to vehicle but this would lose information retaining both vehicle and motorcycle with motorcycle as subclass of vehicle retains all the information we have similarly kind attribute with motorcycle value could be used as well no information is lost but in both cases an unevenness in instance descriptions results as always the basic strategy is the same whether for federations or derived combinations entities relationships subclasses person school enrolled in student school enrolled in person student school enrolled in schema schema schema
