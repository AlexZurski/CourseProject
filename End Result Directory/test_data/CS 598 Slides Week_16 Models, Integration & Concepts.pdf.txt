on to logie logical conceptual two fundamental problems in data management programs and users often interact with data directly via its storage structure and those storage structures vary wildly the intrinsic nature of the information is often not reflected in the management systems these systems to not explicitly reflect the attributes relationships etc that are the genuine components of the

tore purpose and reuse difficult to preserve for future use dependent on memory and workplace practices dependent on custom tools and applications data independence one significant consequence of this chaos is failure of data independence this failure comes in two varieties type if the storage method changes then the end user programs accessing the data will fail to perform as expected type if new kinds of data need to be represented then again end user programs may fail or give the wrong result lets take closer look the solution in 1970 efc odd proposed simple solution efc odd in relational model of data for large shared data banks 1970 perhaps the most cited paper in computer science conceptualize data as relations tables and the nmap those relations to whatever storage methods are being used it changed the world efc odd abstraction and in direction the success of the relational model is based primarily on two related principles abstraction and in direction the relational representation abstracts away from the specific and transient details of storage presenting only the intrinsic features of the data itself subsequent interaction with the stored data is then indirect via mapping from the relational schemas to the stored data  the problem for documents and text its the same problem there are many many ways to represent text and documents interaction is typically directly with these storage structures or via processing instructions the fundamental principles of abstraction and in direction are not followed and all the usual problems ensue the solution in 1981 charles gold far proposed simple solution charles gold far ba generalized approach to document markup in sig plan notices june 1981 conceptualize document as tree rooted and ordered directed cyclic graph of textual data elements and the nmap those elements to to whatever storage or processing methods as needed it also changed the world really heard of html sgml xml charles gold far descriptive markup trees this model describes the logical components of documents it does not specify storage strategies eventhough often inline it does not specify processing it abstracts from storage and processing it connects data to storage and processing by mapping sie by in direction and it uses well understood data structure using xml to serialize tree poem heading the sick rose stanza line rose

destroy tree can be serialized with formal language defined by context free grammar such as an xml language so are we done yet no the old problem solution there are many different ways to use storage methods to store data so we need single data abstraction that allows us to work with data regardless of what storage methods are used the solution the relational model or the tree model the new problem there are many different ways use data abstractions to record information so we need single information abstraction that allows us to work with information regardless of how the data expressing that information is stored the solution in 1976 peter chen proposed simple solution here my interpretation 17 peter pin sha nchen the entity relationship model toward unified view of data acm transactions on database systems 1970 also one of the most influential papers in computer science conceptualize your domain of interest in terms of its things relationships etc and the nmap that

in the new file format security has this data set been tampered with authentication is this the data we think it is reproducibility does this xml file have the same information as that json file provenance were these datasets derived from the same data conversions does the converted file have the same data as the original and on and on there are an unknown number of transformations that are invariant in the sense of preserving the scientific meaning different scientific communities use different tools that require different representations ruth due rr national snow and ice datacenter

propositional interpretative frames data our definition so our answer to the vexed question what is data is data are propositions asserted via symbols and matter and energy ii as evidence du binet al 2009201429 data is not type of thing it is role just as persons are students when enrolled in school propositions are data when asserted as evidence being asserted as evidence is contingent and social circumstance just like being enrolled and so data is role that propositions have in certain contingent social circumstances data is relative so whether propositions are data or claims depends upon what is intended and propositions can be data in one circumstance claims in another in fact science as whole depends on this for instance for climate scientist growth rings on tree rounds maybe evidence for theories about temperature changes but for an evolutionary ecologist those theories about temperature changes may in turn be evidence for theories about competitive advantages in slogan one persons data is another persons theory
