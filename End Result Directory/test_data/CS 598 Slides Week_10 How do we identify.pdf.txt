identity and identifiers content sv why is identification important what are we identifying how do we identify practical example xml canonical iz ation how do we identify how do we identify sameness of proposition show do we identify sameness of syntax how do we identify sameness of encoding so what are we identifying instantiation level semantic level syntax level encoding levels based on the systematic assertion models am for modeling datasets developed by david du binet al for example propositions expressed by rdf triples encoded by rdf xml encoded by unicode characters encoded by utf bitstream inscribed in actual raid array state all mm propositional what are we identifying propositions semantic level symbols syntax level symbols encoding level symbols encoding level symbols encoding level symbols encoding level ne for inscription but operationally identification works from the bottom up we identify the bitstream or character sequence in normal form in order to indirectly identify the higher level encodings syntax or propositional content propositional identity establishing that datasets have the same propositional content can be challenging consider the case where datasets are using completely different modeling approaches in one case relations perhaps stored in csv file in the other case rdf triples perhaps inn determining identity at the propositional level requires translating both datasets into single data representation language nb this has much in common with some of the strategies for data integration and data preservation we have seen and then confirming that every proposition in one is also in the other this can be challenging to say the least so before looking more closely at this hard case encoding identity establishing that two files contain the same sequence of bits is relatively straightforward in the current environment were lyon standard tools that recognize the intended recorded sequence of and within the context on an operating system or storage medium and compare the two bitstream establishing that datasets contain the same sequence of meaningful octets or bytes is usually not particularly difficult either here were lyon tools and standards like utf and utf 16 for recognizing the bytes within bitstream and again comparison is fairly straightforward and for the most part interpreting those bytes as corresponding to integers or directly or indirectly to characters or other semantic tokens is fairly straightforward here were lyon character encoding standards such as ebc dic ascii or unicode to convert byte sequences into characters sequences that can be compared syntax identity establishing that two datasets contain the same representation of relations triples graphs etc is more challenging however this is because so many variations may occur tabs spaces abbreviations etc that are considered irrelevant to syntactical identity even when the same serialization language is being used and establishing that two datasets contain the same relations triples graphs etc is of course even more challenging this is because the same data structure can be represented in different serialization languages now is as good as time as any to point out that the notion used here and elsewhere that things is useful idiom but not only cannot betaken literally but is not really used in the same sense throughout datasets do not contain bits bytes characters syntactical representations and relations all in the same sense of contain in each case generalizing the general problem the things we want to identify can be expressed or encoded in different ways we are typically looking at relationship between propositions and representations representations and encodings encodings and encodings and encoding slather rinse repeat and so we use the lower level instantiations to determine identity of the upper levels entities in other words variation at the lower level does not necessarily entail variation at the upper levels but there is solution to this problem in the next video actually the relationships are mm because of the arbitrary nature of representation described in the data concepts videos that is depending on conventions like standards and other social circumstances agreements decisions intentions expectations the same eg encoding can encode multiple representations but most of the time in identity problems we can ignore this and rely on shared understanding of the relevant concepts
