  the identity problem the identity problem identity problems in data curation identity problems and representation levels identity problems in data curation archiving is this data set already in the archive preservation was the information preserved in the new file format security has this data set been tampered with authentication is this the data we think it is reproducibility does this xml file have the same information as that json file provenance were these datasets derived from the same data conversions does the converted file have the same data as the original and on and on preserving the scientific meaning different scientific communities use different tools that require different representations ruth due rr national snow and ice datacenter data conservancy wiki december 2010 same different same different but same different what consider conversions dc to is obi te ip tote ip mz data to mz ml json to xml and on some conversions are simple format changes some involve change in model type some have schema integration challenges and some have profound heterogeneity problems probably say so in successful conversion something changes and something remains the same but what exactly changes and what remains the same transformations trans coding etc identity problems two biologists jill and john used the same data what does that mean and how can we tell compare two biologists jill and john used the same statistician identity and representation levels consider two files with the same data but relational tables in one case and rdf triples in another same data different representations identity and representation levels consider two files with same data and the same rdf triples but an xml serialization in one case and ann serialization in the other identity and representation levels consider two files with the same data same rdf triples same serialization but an ascii character encoding in one case vs an ebc dic encoding in another identity and representation level show many of these levels are there how do we name define and manage them how can they be identified andre identified identity conditions so underlying many data curation issues is the problem of identity is is the same data document text image as the conceptual question what do we mean the operational question how do we tell
